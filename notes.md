# ABSTRACT

## Bloom + NPC
I show that the phenology of the spring phytoplankton bloom and the positioning
and strength of the North Pacific Current are strongly associated with changes
in productivity. However, the direction (spring bloom) and
magnitude (currents) of the estimated effects were dependent on the latitude
of juvenile salmon ocean entry with northern salmon populations (Alaska)
responding differently than southern salmon populations (British Columbia and
Washington).

An early
spring bloom was associated with higher productivity for Alaska salmon
populations and lower productivity for British Columbia salmon populations.

I begin by investigating specific components of two alternative environmental
forcing pathways.

These results suggest that

I show that the phenology of the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser
extent phytoplankton biomass) is strongly associated with changes in salmon
productivity, although the direction of the effect was dependent on the
geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry. Next, I again use a
cross-system comparative approach to examine an alternative hypothesis that
horizontal ocean transport is a critical driver of Pacific salmon productivity.
I show that horizontal ocean transport can strongly affect salmon productivity
for stocks in Washington and British Columbia, but not for more northern stocks
in Alaska, suggesting that a different mechanism may underlie changes in
productivity for salmon stocks in this region.

I show that mismatches in the scale at which ecosystem services are provided by
Pacific salmon and the scale at which natural and anthropogenic forcing
impact those services strongly contribute to the barriers
preventing more effective integration. I further suggest two potential
strategies to enhance integration of Pacific salmon into ecosystem-based
management policies including creation of an international ecosystem synthesis
group to facilitate the synthesis of information across multiple spatial scales
and the expanded
use of dynamic in-season management policies that allow rapid updating of
management decisions based on evolving information about ecosystem conditions.

this region.


## Other

In coastal Northeast Pacific ecosystems, the effects of climate variability
on the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species are often hypothesized to be
mediated by either vertical or horizontal ocean transport processes.

Vertical ocean transport processes (e.g., upwelling) can influence
higher-trophic-level species by altering phytoplankton dynamics in coastal
ecosystems and subsequently, food resource availability for higher-trophic-level
species. Horizontal ocean transport processes (e.g., ocean currents) can
influence the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species in coastal ecosystems by
altering either physical oceanographic conditions or the advection of food
resources into coastal areas.

In this thesis, I examine potential environmental forcing pathways linking
climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
(\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.


In coastal ecosystems, two sets of environmental forcing pathways are often
hypothesized to link climate variability and dynamics of higher-trophic-level
species.

I begin by using a cross-system comparative approach to assess the evidence for
population-level responses to inter-annual changes in two meso-scale ocean
processes, phytoplankton dynamics and ocean current patterns.

I show that the phenology of the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser
extent phytoplankton biomass) is strongly associated with changes in salmon
productivity, although the direction of the effect was dependent on the
geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry.

Next, I show that the positioning and strength of ocean currents in the
Northeast Pacific can strongly affect salmon productivity for stocks in
Washington and British Columbia, but not for more northern stocks in Alaska,
suggesting that a different mechanism may underlie changes in productivity for
salmon stocks in this region.


First, vertical ocean transport (e.g., upwelling) can influence the
higher-trophic-level species by altering phytoplankton dynamics in coastal
ecosystems and subsequently, food resource availability for higher-trophic-level
species.

Second, horizontal ocean transport can influence the dynamics of
higher-trophic-level species in coastal ecosystems by altering either physical
oceanographic conditions or the advection of food resources into coastal areas.

## Draft 1

A central problem in fisheries science is understanding how environmental
forcing influences demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations.
In this thesis, I examine potential environmental forcing pathways linking
climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
(\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin
by using a cross-system comparative approach to assess the evidence for
population-level responses to inter-annual changes in phytoplankton dynamics. I
show that the phenology of the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser
extent phytoplankton biomass) is strongly associated with changes in salmon
productivity, although the direction of the effect was dependent on the
geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry. Next, I again use a
cross-system comparative approach to examine an alternative hypothesis that
horizontal ocean transport is a critical driver of Pacific salmon productivity.
I show that horizontal ocean transport can strongly affect salmon productivity
for stocks in Washington and British Columbia, but not for more northern stocks
in Alaska, suggesting that a different mechanism may underlie changes in
productivity for salmon stocks in this region. Next, I use a novel quantitative
method, probabilistic networks, to examine the cumulative effects and relative
importance of multiple environmental pathways on salmon dynamics. I show that
multiple environmental pathways can simultaneously impact salmon population
dynamics, including multiple pathways that originate from the same climatic
process. Finally, I use a policy perspective to show that mismatches in the
scale at which ecosystem services are provided by Pacific salmon and the scale
at which human activities and natural processes impact those services need to be
explicitly accounted for ecosystem-based management policies. My thesis
demonstrates that climatic and ocean processes can impact higher-trophic-level
species via simultaneously operating environmental pathways---including pathways
mediated by either vertical or horizontal ocean transport---and that the
relative importance of these pathways can be non-stationary through space.

## Draft 2

Rapid environmental change from natural or anthropogenic forcing can have
profound impacts on the structure and function of marine and coastal ecosystems.
Yet, determining environmental drivers governing shifts in demographic rates of
commercially valuable fish species remains an elusive problem that has practical
management implications. In this thesis, I use a cross-system comparative
approach to examine environmental forcing pathways linking climatic and ocean
processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon (\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin by investigating the vertical ocean
transport hypothesis, which suggests that vertical ocean transport processes
(e.g., upwelling) mediate the effects of climate variability on Pacific salmon
by altering phytoplankton dynamics in coastal ecosystems and subsequently, food
resource availability for juvenile Pacific salmon. I show that the phenology of
the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser extent phytoplankton biomass) is
strongly associated with inter-annual changes in salmon productivity. The
direction of the effect, however, was dependent on the latitude of juvenile
salmon ocean entry; an early spring bloom was associated with higher
productivity for Alaska salmon populations and lower productivity for British
Columbia salmon populations. Next, I assess the evidence for an alternative
hypothesis, which suggests horizontal ocean transport processes (e.g., ocean
currents) also mediate the effects of climate variability on Pacific salmon by
altering either physical oceanographic conditions or the advection of food
resources into coastal areas. I show that for salmon stocks located in
Washington and British Columbia, variability in both the positioning and
strength of the North Pacific Current are strongly associated with changes in
productivity. In contrast, I show much weaker effects of horizontal ocean
transport on productivity of salmon stocks in Alaska, suggesting that a
different mechanism may underlie changes in productivity for salmon stocks in
this region. Next, I use a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks, to
examine the joint effect and relative strength of 17 potential environmental
pathways linking large-scale climate processes to Pacific salmon dynamics. I
show that among the pathways considered, pathways originating with the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation are the most influential on Pacific salmon dynamics with a
joint effect considerably larger than that of the pathways originating with
other large-scale climate processes. Finally, I use a policy perspective to
examine how challenges arising from a highly migratory life history, imperfect
information, and ecosystem complexity can impede efforts to integrate Pacific
salmon into ecosystem-based management policies. My findings indicate that
ecosystem-based management policies need to explicitly account for mismatches in
the scale at which ecosystem services are provided by highly migratory species
and the scale at which human activities and natural processes impact those
services in order to achieve more effective integration. Collectively, my thesis
demonstrates that climatic and ocean processes can impact higher-trophic-level
species via simultaneously operating environmental pathways---including pathways
mediated by either vertical or horizontal ocean transport---and that the
relative importance of these pathways can be non-stationary through space.

Rapid environmental change from natural or anthropogenic forcing can have

Yet, determining environmental drivers governing shifts in demographic rates of

management implications. In this thesis, I use a cross-system comparative
approach to examine environmental forcing pathways linking climatic and ocean
processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon (\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin by assessing the evidence for
population-level responses to inter-annual changes in two meso-scale ocean
processes, phytoplankton dynamics and ocean currents, which represent links
within two alternative environmental forcing pathways. In the first pathway,
vertical ocean transport processes (e.g., upwelling) are hypothesized to mediate
the effects of climate variability on Pacific salmon by altering phytoplankton
dynamics in coastal ecosystems and subsequently, food resource availability for
juvenile Pacific salmon. In the second pathway, horizontal ocean transport
processes (e.g., ocean currents) are hypothesized to mediate the effects of
climate variability on Pacific salmon by altering the advection of food
resources into coastal areas. I show that both phytoplankton dynamics and ocean
current patterns are strongly associated with changes in salmon productivity.
However, the magnitude and direction of the effects are dependent on the
latitude of juvenile salmon ocean entry with northern salmon populations (i.e.,
Alaska) and southern populations (i.e., British Columbia and Washington)
responding differently to changes in the meso-scale ocean processes. This
suggests that different mechanism may underlie changes in productivity for
salmon stocks in northern and southern areas. Next, I use a novel quantitative

## Draft 4

Environmental change resulting from natural or anthropogenic forcing can have
profound impacts on the structure and function of marine and coastal ecosystems.
Yet, determining environmental processes governing population dynamics of marine
and anadromous fish species remains an elusive problem that has practical
management implications. In this thesis, I use a cross-system comparative

processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon (\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin by assessing the evidence for
population-level responses to inter-annual changes in two meso-scale ocean
processes, phytoplankton dynamics and ocean currents, which represent critical
links within two alternative sets of environmental forcing pathways. In the
first set of pathways, vertical ocean transport (e.g., upwelling) is
hypothesized to mediate the effects of large-scale climate variability on
higher-trophic-level species by altering primary and secondary production. In
contrast, in the second set of pathways, horizontal ocean transport (e.g., ocean
currents) is hypothesized to mediate climate variability by altering the
advection of food resources into coastal areas. I show that both phytoplankton
dynamics and ocean current patterns are strongly associated with changes in
salmon productivity, suggesting that both sets of alternative pathways may drive
salmon dynamics. However, the magnitude and direction of the effects were
conditional on the latitude of juvenile salmon ocean entry, suggesting that the
relative importance of different environmental pathways may be region dependent.
Next, I use a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks, to examine the
joint effect and relative strength of 17 potential environmental pathways
linking large-scale climate processes to Pacific salmon dynamics. I show that
multiple environmental pathways can simultaneously impact salmon population
dynamics, including multiple pathways originating from the same climatic

# CONCLUSION

## Spatial non-stationarity
1. My second and third chapters indicated that the effects of phytoplankton
   dynamics and horizontal ocean transport on salmon productivity were dependent
   on the geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry, suggesting that in
   some cases environmental forcing is non-stationary across space. A practical
   implication of this spatial non-stationarity is that relationships inferred
   from data in one location may not be applicable to another location.

initiation date and horizontal ocean transport on salmon productivity were

implication of this spatial non-stationarity is that relationships inferred from
data in one location may not be applicable to another location. Evidence for
changes in the effects of environmental forcing across space also highlights the
importance of using cross-system comparative research approaches to gain
understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

Second, this thesis provides evidence that the effects of environmental forcing
on higher-trophic-level species is non-stationary across space. In other words,
the functional form or magnitude of the effect size of ecological relationships
may be dependent on the spatial context. For example, chapters 1 and 2 indicated
sharp differences in the effects of phytoplankton dynamics and ocean current
patterns between the stocks that enter the ocean in the predominantly
downwelling domain of the Northern Gulf of Alaska and stocks that enter the
ocean in the more southern upwelling domain. Similar spatial non-stationarity
has also been shown in the relationships between sea surface temperature and
salmon productivity, where cooler sea surface temperatures tend to be associated
with increased salmon productivity in southern areas and lower productivity in
northern areas.

My thesis also provides some evidence that the effects of environmental forcing
on higher-trophic-level species is non-stationary across space. My second and
third chapters indicated that the effects of the spring bloom initiation date
and horizontal ocean transport on salmon productivity were dependent on the
geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry. This result is consistent
with previous work on Pacific salmon that indicated that the effects of sea
surface temperature are dependent on the latitude of ocean entry of a salmon
stock. A practical implication of this spatial non-stationarity is that
relationships inferred from data in one location may not be applicable to
another location. Evidence for changes in the effects of environmental forcing
across space also highlights the importance of using cross-system comparative
research approaches to gain understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

   environmental forcing across space also highlights the importance of using
   cross-system comparative research approaches to gain understanding of
   ecosystem dynamics. Although manipulative experiments are often viewed as the
   gold standard for gaining causal understanding of a system, in fisheries
   science, undertaking these types of experiments at scales relevant to
   management is often not practical. In the absence of manipulative
   experiments, comparative research approaches offer an alternative that can
   leverage data across multiple spatial and temporal scales to better
   understand the dynamics of the system. For example, in chapters two and three
   I use hierarchical models to estimate the effects of meso-scale ocean
   processes on salmon productivity. By effectively using the many salmon data
   sets as replicates within the analysis, this approach can help reduce
   uncertainties associated with the physical and biological processes that
   underlie dynamics of exploited species.

## Multiple competing hypotheses

3. The support for simultaneously operating pathways provided in my thesis
   highlights the need to pursue evidence for multiple competing hypotheses to
   explain observed patterns in the dynamics of marine and anadromous fish
   species. Over a century ago, Chamberlin @Chamberlin1965 warned that "We
   [scientists] are so prone to attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that,
   when we find an agency present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith,
   and fail to recognize that it is but one factor, and perchance a minor
   factor, in the accomplishment of the total result." Yet, broadening our focus
   beyond a single hypothesis or set of hypotheses focused around a single
   mechanism remains challenging. For example, the research presented in this
   thesis largely assumes that environmental pathways linking climatic and ocean
   processes to Pacific salmon dynamics occur through bottom-up forcing
   mechanisms. Changes in climatic and physical ocean processes, however, can
   simultaneously impact food resource availability and predator distributions
   (or abundances) and only considering environmental forcing pathways that
   represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete. Increasing our ability
   to detect and anticipate the effects of perturbations on marine ecosystems
   may be dependent on evaluating the relative importance of competing
   hypotheses and the cumulative impacts of multiple mechanisms hypothesized to
   drive the observed changes.

3. Together, chapters two, three, and four highlight the need to purse evidence
   for multiple competing hypotheses to explain observed changes in demographic
   rates of exploited species. Over a century ago, Chamberlin @Chamberlin1965
   warned that "We [scientists] are so prone to attribute a phenomenon to a
   single cause, that, when we find an agency present, we are liable to rest
   satisfied therewith, and fail to recognize that it is but one factor, and
   perchance a minor factor, in the accomplishment of the total result." Yet,
   broadening our focus beyond a single hypothesis or set of hypotheses focused
   around a single mechanism remains challenging. For instance, in this thesis I
   largely assume that climatic and ocean processes influence Pacific salmon
   through bottom-up pressures. However, only considering environmental forcing
   pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete as changes
   in climatic and physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food
   resource availability and predator distributions or abundances. Future
   research should strive to further understand interactions and cumulative
   effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic levels,
   e.g., by estimating the cumulative effects and relative importance of
   multiple hypothesized pathways linking climatic changes and the dynamics of
   exploited species.

   For example, the relative importance of environmental forcing and the
   effects of fishing in controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations
   has been widely debated in fisheries science. In many cases, separating the
   effects of fishing and environmental forcing may not be possible
   without extreme management actions. Yet, climate change is already
   having profound impacts on some marine species and the projected increase in
   extreme events, such as marine heat waves, could have widespread impacts on
   exploited species. Understanding the inter-actions between environmental
   forcing and the effects of fishing ...


   re-organizing the spatial distributions of many species

   including a broader range of competing hypotheses

the effects of environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level fish species has
been, and continues to be, debated in fisheries science [@Walters1988a;
@Skud1975]. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations.

   Avoiding such attachments to a single hypothesis may be an important to
   increasing our ability to detect and anticipate the effects of perturbations
   on marine ecosystems.

   In particular, increasing our ability to detect and anticipate the effects of
   perturbations on marine ecosystems will likely require understanding both the
   relative importance of competing hypotheses and the cumulative impacts of
   the mechanisms hypothesized to drive the observed changes.

   For example, attributing a population response to environmental forcing that
   occur through either bottom-up and top-down pathways has been a long standing
   challenge in fisheries oceanography.


   Often times competing
   hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and in these situations efforts should
   be made to understand the cumulative effects


   As my fourth chapter indicates, multiple environmental
   pathways arising from the same climate process can contribute to explaining
   the observed variability in the populations dynamics of Pacific salmon.
   disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways.

   Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels.

   More generally, it may be prudent to place a high priority on identifying
   the potential range of causal mechanisms and seeking evidence for these
   alternative hypotheses, as well as seeking to understand the cumulative
   effects and relative importance of competing hypotheses.

   Only considering a single environmental variable or
   forcing pathway when attempting to understand the drivers of the dynamics of
   exploited species is inherently incomplete.

   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels.


   that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels. For instance, as the climate warms, the relative importance of
   bottom-up and top-down pathways may shift as marine species track preferred
   environmental conditions [@Pinsky2013].

## Challenges remaining

3. This thesis also reveals several remaining challenges in understanding the
   effects of environmental forcing on living marine resources. A first
   challenge is disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that occur
   through bottom-up and top-down pathways. Changes in climatic and physical
   ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability and
   predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental forcing
   pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete and future
   research should strive to further understand interactions and cumulative
   effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic levels. For
   instance, as the climate warms, the relative importance of bottom-up and
   top-down pathways may shift as marine species track preferred environmental
   conditions [@Pinsky2013]. End-to-end ecosystem models (e.g., Atlantis)
   provide one option for improving our understanding of interactions between
   bottom-up and top-down pressures on exploited species, however, in many
   systems data may not be available to parameterize such models. Alternatively,
   models of intermediate complexity, which can allow for environmental
   influence on trophic interactions, may prove useful in disentangling the
   effects of top-down and bottom-up pressures [@Plaganyi2014].

4. An extension of this first challenge is recognizing the need to pursue
   evidence for multiple competing hypotheses to explain observed patterns in
   the dynamics of marine and anadromous fish species. Over a century ago,
   Chamberlin @Chamberlin1965 warned that "We [scientists] are so prone to
   attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an agency
   present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to recognize
   that it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in the
   accomplishment of the total result." Yet, broadening our focus beyond a
   single hypothesis or set of hypotheses focused around a single mechanism
   remains challenging.

5. Another challenge is identifying how relationships between environmental
   processes and demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations
   vary over time. Increasingly, evidence suggests that both environmental
   processes and demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations are
   non-stationary through time. Similar to the implications of spatial
   non-stationarity observed in this thesis, temporal non-stationarity in
   driver-response relationships implies that relationships inferred from past
   observation may not hold today and this non-stationarity may partially
   explain why environmental correlations frequently break down over time.
   Time-varying relationships present a particularly difficult challenge for
   projecting how future climate changes may impact living marine resources
   because using historical data to project future outcomes may be misleading.
   Advancements in quantitative methods, such as state-space modeling
   approaches, may provide a useful starting place to find clues on the
   prevalence of time-varying relationships.

is identifying how relationships between environmental processes and demographic
rates of marine and anadromous fish populations vary over time.

3. This thesis also reveals several remaining challenges in detecting and
   anticipating the effects of environmental forcing on living marine resources.

   A first challenge is disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways. Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete

   levels.

   A second challenge is identifying how driver-response relationships vary over
   time. Increasingly, evidence suggests that both environmental processes and
   demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations are
   non-stationary through time. Similar to the implications of spatial
   non-stationarity observed in this thesis, temporal non-stationarity in
   driver-response relationships implies that relationships inferred from past
   observation may not hold today and this non-stationarity may partially
   explain why environmental correlations frequently break down over time.
   Time-varying relationships present a particularly difficult challenge for

   because using historical data to project future outcomes may be misleading.
   Advancements in quantitative methods, such as state-space modeling
   approaches, may provide a useful starting place to find clues on the
   prevalence of time-varying relationships.

   A third challenge is recognizing the need to investigate multiple competing
   hypotheses to explain observed patterns. As my fourth chapter indicates,
   multiple environmental pathways arising from the same climate process can
   contribute to explaining the observed variability in the populations dynamics
   of Pacific salmon. Over a century ago, Chamberlin (1890) warned that "We are
   so prone to attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an
   agency present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to
   recognize that it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in the
   accomplishment of the total result."





Over the next few decades, addressing these types of challenges may be a
   critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.


   The pursuit of evidence for multiple
   competing hypotheses may be an important component of developing policies
   that

   A third challenge is moving beyond a correlation based understanding
   of ecosystem dynamics to a more causal mechanistic understanding. Despite the
   common refrain that correlation does not imply causation, correlations based
   studies still comprise a large fraction of the research on how environmental
   forcing influences marine and anadromous species. The reliance on correlation
   based studies is partly due to the difficulty in carrying out manipulative
   experiments at scales that are meaningful for management. However, several
   techniques and emerging approaches show promising in helping to improve our
   causal understanding of the system including spatial dynamics of
   driver-response relationships, meta-analytic modeling approaches that can
   synthesize data across multiple spatial scales,

   critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.

   variables can help determine

   Second, meta-analytic modeling approaches (e.g., hierarchical modeling),

critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.



As management of marine resources increasingly moves towards ecosystem-based
approaches to management, strategic management advice based on empirical
evidence


This will likely occur at a species and system specific basis.



3. This thesis also reveals several remaining challenges in detecting and
   anticipating the effects of environmental forcing on living marine resources.
   A first challenge is disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways. Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels. For instance, as the climate warms, the relative importance of
   bottom-up and top-down pathways may shift as marine species track preferred
   environmental conditions [@Pinsky2013]. End-to-end ecosystem models (e.g.,
   Atlantis) provide one option for improving our understanding of interactions
   between bottom-up and top-down pressures on exploited species, however, in
   many systems data may not be available to parameterize such models.
   Alternatively, models of intermediate complexity, which can allow for
   environmental influence on trophic interactions, may prove useful in
   disentangling the effects of top-down and bottom-up pressures
   [@Plaganyi2014].

4. A second major challenge is moving beyond a correlation based understanding
   of ecosystem dynamics to a more mechanistic understanding. A major limitation
   of relying on correlative relationships to increase our understanding of
   ecosystem dynamics is that these relationships frequently break down over
   time. In this thesis I use two separate techniques to help increase the
   reliability of the correlation based results.

   First, examining the spatial scales of variability in the driver and response
   variables

   Second, meta-analytic modeling approaches (e.g., hierarchical modeling),

   Research on the effects of environmental forcing on marine species often rely
   on variables that represent proxies for other variables that are thought to
   more directly impact the dynamics of the focal species. For example, in
   chapter 4 I use indices of horizontal ocean transport variability

   This use of proxy variables is usually necessitated due to poor data
   availability for processes that are

   With the advent of widespread availability of ocean remote sensing data and
   the increased availability of output from regional ocean modeling systems

Disentangling the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,
changes in environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many
drivers. For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence
the distribution of predator populations and the availability of food
resources. Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on
fish populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds,
and reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change
affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of
competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.

Only considering environmental forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing
is inherently incomplete and future research should strive to further understand
interactions and cumulative effects of processes driving food resource
availability and predator abundances and distributions. The methods outlined in
my fourth chapter (i.e., probabilistic networks), may provide a useful starting
point for estimating cumulative effects and relative importance of bottom-up and
top-down drivers of productivity of marine species.

For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the
distribution of predator populations and the availability of food resources.
Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on fish
populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and
reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects
fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of competing
hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.


In this thesis, and the majority of ecological research, environmental driver
and population response relationships are assumed to be constant through time,
i.e., the mean effect is assumed to be stationary. However, evidence suggests
that productivity of marine and anadromous fish species varies over time.
Non-stationarity in driver-response relationships implies that previously
identified relationships may not hold in the future. If these relationships do
vary over time, it suggests that using historical data to project future
outcomes may be misleading.

Despite these advances in understanding how environmental forcing varies across
space, there has less effort in understanding how relationships between
demographic rates of exploited species and environmental conditions change
across time.

The unprecedented rate of environmental change in many marine systems highlights
the importance of increasing our understanding of the pathways that connect
climate and ocean processes to exploited marine species. Yet, integrating
information about environmental forcing into applied management situations


better understanding how ecological driver-response relationships vary over
time. In this thesis, and the majority of ecological research, environmental
driver and population response relationships are assumed to be constant through
time, i.e., the mean effect is assumed to be stationary. However, evidence
suggests that productivity of marine and anadromous fish species varies over
time. Non-stationarity in driver-response relationships implies that previously
identified relationships may not hold in the future. In the presence of
unprecedented rates of change in climate and ocean systems, understanding how
relationships change over space and time will be a critical component to
increasing our ability to detect and anticipate rapid changes in productivity of
commercially valuable species.

## First paragraph (summary)

In this thesis, I have sought to contribute to our knowledge of how
environmental forcing pathways link climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of
Pacific salmon populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In chapter 1, I used
a cross-system comparative approach to examine the hypothesis that phytoplankton
dynamics in coastal ecosystem are an important driver of higher-trophic-level
species productivity. Results from this chapter indicated that the phenology of
the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser extent phytoplankton biomass) is
strongly associated with salmon productivity, although the direction of the
effect was dependent on the geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry.
In chapter 2, I again used a cross-system comparative approach to examine the
alternative hypothesis that horizontal ocean transport is a critical driver of
Pacific salmon productivity. Results from chapter 2 suggested that horizontal
ocean transport can strongly affect salmon productivity for stocks in Washington
and British Columbia, but not for more northern stocks in Alaska. In chapter 3,
I used a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks, to examine the
cumulative effects and relative importance of multiple environmental pathways on
salmon dynamics. Results from this chapter provide evidence that multiple
environmental pathways can simultaneously impact salmon population dynamics,
including multiple pathways that originate from the same climatic process. In
chapter 4, I used a policy perspective to show that mismatches in the scale at
which ecosystem services are provided by Pacific salmon and the scale at which
human activities and natural processes impact those services need to be
explicitly accounted for ecosystem-based management policies.

  My second and third chapters apply a cross-system comparative approach to
  examine the role phytoplankton dynamics and horizontal ocean transport play in
  driving Pacific salmon population dynamics.

  My fourth chapter applies a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks,
  to examine the cumulative effects and relative importance of multiple
  environmental pathways on salmon dynamics.

  My fifth chapter uses a policy perspective to show that mismatches in the
  scale at which ecosystem services are provided by Pacific salmon and the scale
  at which human activities and natural processes impact those services need to
  be explicitly accounted for ecosystem-based management policies.


In chapters 1 and 2, I used a cross-system comparative approach to examine
specific components of two alternative environmental pathways that have been
hypothesized to link climate processes and Pacific salmon.

2. My thesis makes several contributions to the study of environmental forcing
   in coastal ecosystems. My thesis provides evidence supporting the idea that
   multiple environmental forcing pathways connect climatic and ocean processes
   to dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. In chapters two and three, I
   show that environmental forcing pathways mediated by either vertical or
   horizontal ocean transport processes can impact the dynamics of
   higher-trophic-level species. Although I investigate the effects of
   phytoplankton dynamics and ocean currents on salmon productivity
   individually, these meso-scale ocean processes likely influence
   higher-trophic-levels species simultaneously. Indeed, my fourth chapter
   indicates that large-scale climate processes can impact Pacific salmon
   year-class strength via multiple simultaneously operating environmental
   pathways. For instance, large-scale variability indexed by the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation may downscale to affect regional and local scale dynamics
   of Pacific salmon through concurrent pathways that are mediated by either
   horizontal or vertical ocean transport. Disentangling the effects of
   alternative forcing pathways is an important challenge and future research
   should strive to further understand the cumulative effects and relative
   importance of multiple mechanisms hypothesized to drive ecosystem dynamics.

2. My thesis makes several contributions to the study of environmental forcing
   in coastal ecosystems. My second and third chapters provide evidence that
   environmental forcing pathways mediated by either vertical or horizontal
   ocean transport processes can strongly impact the dynamics of
   higher-trophic-level species. In both studies, however, the effects of
   environmental conditions were dependent on the geographic location of
   juvenile salmon ocean entry, suggesting that in some cases environmental
   forcing is non-stationary across space. A practical implication of this
   spatial non-stationarity is that relationships inferred from data in one
   location may not be applicable to another location. My fourth chapter further
   shows the need to account for multiple environmental pathways when
   considering how environmental forcing impacts higher-trophic-level species,
   e.g., by estimating the cumulative effects and relative importance of
   multiple hypothesized pathways linking climatic changes and the dynamics of
   exploited species. My fifth chapter indicates that considering spatial scales
   of the impacts of human and natural disturbances on highly-migratory species
   is an important component to integrating these species into ecosystem-based
   management policies. Together, the results presented in this thesis strongly
   suggest that climatic and ocean processes can impact salmon populations
   simultaneously through multiple environmental pathways and that the relative
   importance of these pathways may be non-stationary through space.

   Only considering a single pathway/mechanisms is likely insufficient to
   understand how environmental forcing impacts living marine resources. We also
   need to understand the relative importance and cumulative effects of multiple
   pathways.

   More generally, it may be prudent to place a high priority on identifying
   the potential range of causal mechanisms and seeking evidence for these
   alternative hypotheses, as well as seeking to understand the cumulative
   effects and relative importance of competing hypotheses.

My fifth chapter indicates that considering spatial scales of the impacts of
human and natural disturbances on highly-migratory species is an important
component to integrating these species into ecosystem-based management policies.

Third, failure to account for impacts of human and natural processes across the
entire migratory range of Pacific salmon may inhibit

4. Accounting for spatial dynamics in natural and anthropogenic forcing and a
   populations response to this forcing is  a necessary component to integrating
   highly-migratory Pacific salmon into EBM policies.

   For example, results of chapter 4 indicated the strongest effects of
   horizontal ocean transport were limited in extent to stocks that enter the
   ocean south of approximately 55N, suggesting that different mechanisms may
   underlie salmon dynamics in areas north and south of this latitude.

2. My thesis makes several contributions to the study of environmental forcing
   in coastal ecosystems. My second and third chapters advance our understanding
   about the relationships between two alternative meso-scale ocean processes
   and productivity of Pacific salmon populations. Results from these two
   chapters provide evidence that environmental forcing pathways mediated by
   either vertical or horizontal ocean transport processes can strongly impact
   the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. My fourth chapter further
   suggests the need to account for multiple environmental pathways when
   considering how environmental forcing impacts higher-trophic-level species,
   e.g., by estimating the cumulative effects and relative importance of
   multiple hypothesized pathways linking climatic changes and the dynamics of
   exploited species.



   Evidence for changes in the effects of environmental forcing across space
   also highlights the importance of using cross-system comparative research
   approaches to gain understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Although manipulative
   experiments are often viewed as the gold standard for gaining causal
   understanding of a system, in fisheries science, undertaking these types of
   experiments at scales relevant to management is often not practical. In the
   absence of manipulative experiments, comparative research approaches offer an
   alternative that can leverage data across multiple spatial and temporal
   scales to better understand the dynamics of the system. For example, in
   chapters two and three I use hierarchical models to estimate the effects of
   meso-scale ocean processes on salmon productivity. By effectively using the
   many salmon data sets as replicates within the analysis, this approach can
   help reduce uncertainties associated with the physical and biological
   processes that underlie dynamics of exploited species.

   meta-analytic modeling approaches, such as the hierarchical models used in
   chapters two and three, can help reduce the chances of finding spurious
   relationships and help reduce uncertainties associated with the physical and
   biological processes that underlie dynamics of exploited species by using the
   many available population data sets as replicates within the analysis.



---

My second and third chapters advance our understanding about the relationships
between two alternative meso-scale ocean processes and productivity of Pacific
salmon. My fourth chapter extends this work by assessing the evidence for
multiple environmental forcing pathways to influence the dynamics of Pacific
salmon dynamics. Together, these three chapters provide evidence that multiple
environmental pathways---including multiple pathways arising from the same
climatic process---can simultaneously impact the dynamics of
higher-trophic-level species.

Only considering a single pathway/mechanisms is likely insufficient to
understand how environmental forcing impacts living marine resources. We also
need to understand the relative importance and cumulative effects of multiple
pathways.

For example, the results of chapter 1 indicate that biological oceanographic
processes (e.g. phytoplankton phenology) that are largely driven by vertical
ocean transport mechanisms are strongly associated with salmon productivity.
Similarly, results of chapter 2 indicated that horizontal ocean transport is
also strongly associated with salmon productivity in some regions. Finally,
chapter 3 indicated that multiple environmental pathways originating with the
PDO had strong effects on salmon dynamics. This suggests that future research
effects should focus on understanding the relative importance and cumulative
effects of multiple potential pathways linking large-scale climatic processes
and the dynamics of higher trophic level species.

In addition to the specific contributions of each chapter, this thesis provides
two important contributions to our understanding of how environmental forcing
impacts the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. First, this thesis
provides evidence that multiple environmental pathways, potentially arising from
the same climatic process, can simultaneously impact the dynamics of
higher-trophic-level species. For example, the results of chapter 1 indicate
that biological oceanographic processes (e.g. phytoplankton phenology) that are
largely driven by vertical ocean transport mechanisms are strongly associated
with salmon productivity. Similarly, results of chapter 2 indicated that
horizontal ocean transport is also strongly associated with salmon productivity
in some regions. Finally, chapter 3 indicated that multiple environmental
pathways originating with the PDO had strong effects on salmon dynamics. This
suggests that future research effects should focus on understanding the relative
importance and cumulative effects of multiple potential pathways linking
large-scale climatic processes and the dynamics of higher trophic level species.



## Main conclusions from chapters

1. "Our results suggest that changes in spring bloom timing resulting from
   natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change could potentially
   cause latitudinal shifts in salmon productivity."

2. "Our results indicated that horizontal transport pathways may strongly
   influence population dynamics of Pacific salmon in the southern part of their
   North American ranges, but not the northern part, suggesting that different
   environmental pathways may underlie changes in salmon productivity in
   northern and southern areas for the species under consideration."

3. "Our results provide evidence that shifts in climate patterns could strongly
   influence recruitment simultaneously through multiple ecological pathways and
   highlight the importance of quantifying cumulative effects of these pathways
   on higher-trophic-level species."

4. "Our findings further suggest that ecosystem-based management policies need
   to explicitly account for mismatches in the scale at which ecosystem services
   are generated by highly migratory species and the scale at which human
   activities and natural processes impact those services."

## Outline

1. Summary of the four research chapters
2. Main contributions resulting from this thesis
3. Challenges
    - non-stationarity
    - uncertainties will always be present
        - need methods to deal with these uncertainties
    - Need to account for multiple mechanisms/pathways
        - No 'smoking gun'
        - Multiple ecological pathways
        - Need to take into account multiple ecological pathways rather than
          searching for a mythical 'smoking gun'
    - top-down + fishing effects
    - environmental information and management advice
    - non-linearity
    - complexity
4. Outlook
    * Climate change impacts on importance of different pathways
    1. Extreme events
    2. Shifting temperature isotherms

* Macro-scale perspective is useful
    - Salmon ecology
    - Management and conservation


## Questions

1. What is the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forcing pathways?

2. How will changing distributions of marine species impact predator
   distributions and abundances?

3. How will ocean acidification impact food resource availability?

4. How will extreme climate and ocean events, e.g., marine heat waves, impact
   year class strength?

5. How do the effects of exploitation interact with environmental variability?

6. Do environmental driver population response relationships vary over time?

7. Is there evidence for threshold and other non-linear effects of the
   environment on Pacific salmon demographic rates?

8. Does the relative importance of competing hypothesis change over time?

- As the climate changes at an unprecedented rate, maintaining viable and
  productive marine and anadromous fish populations will require the ability to
  anticipate how ecological perturbations affect demographic rates of exploited
  species. The contributions to our understanding of how climatic and ocean
  processes relate to demographic rates of Pacific salmon presented in this
  thesis represent a single step in increasing this ability.
  However, many important questions remain. For example, what is the relative
  importance of top-down and bottom-up forcing pathways and how will changing
  distributions of marine species impact this relative importance? How will
  changing thermal isotherms and increased ocean acidification impact food
  resource availability for juvenile Pacific salmon? What evidence is there for
  temporal non-stationarity in relationships between environmental forcing and
  productivity of exploited species? Over the next few decades, answering these
  types of questions may...
      - be a critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.
      - determine our ability to maintain viable and productive living marine
        resources.

   Suggesting that broad-scale climate variability is filtered through regional-
   and local-scale processes.

## Management

- The utility of the results of this thesis are likely best used in the context
  of short-term projections of year class strength. For example, probabilistic
  networks, such as the ones constructed in chapter four, could be used provide
  one or two year forecasts of total recruitment of salmon populations.

- Moving toward a more mechanistic understanding of the drivers in population
  processes will be needed to inform tactical-management advice.

## Conclusion

Effective decision-making in the presence of large uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge of managing living marine resources. Environmental variability is an
intrinsic element of coastal ecosystems and can have profound impacts on
ecosystem structure and function as well as the human-derived benefits from the
system. As climatic processes and ecosystem dynamics change at unprecedented
rates, reducing uncertainties about the impacts of changing environmental
conditions on living marine resources uncertainties about the impacts of
changing environmental conditions on living marine resources may be a critical
component to maintaining viable and productive fish populations.

Ultimately, understanding how environmental forcing impacts commercially
valuable species is a necessary component to implementing management actions
that are robust to a wide range of potential future scenarios.

- Effective decision-making in the presence of profound environmental change is
  a critical challenge of managing living marine resources. Large uncertainties
  about the effects of environmental change, whether due to anthropogenic or
  natural sources, on exploited marine and anadromous fish species

- Although it is widely recognized that variability in the structure and
  function of marine ecosystems, is in part, driven by environmental
  stochasticity, there continues to be deep uncertainties about the effects of
  environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level species.

- For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at
  an unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for
  the effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to
  the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery [@Pershing2015]. Thus, avoiding
  similar undesirable management outcomes in the future will likely require
  understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact marine and
  anadromous fish populations.

- Indeed, three lines of evidence suggests that environmental change is a
  leading driver of variability in population productivity for many exploited
  marine and anadromous fish populations, and thereby affecting a populations
  response to harvesting and its speed of recovery from depletion [CITE]. First,
  paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations experienced large
  fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial fishing
  [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent effects
  often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
  [@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a; @Cury2014]. Finally, shifts in the
  underlying mean productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental
  regime shifts [@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a; @Rothschild2000a].


## Research overview

In this thesis, I aim to add to that quantitative understanding by using a
cross-system comparative approach to examine ecological pathways[^2] linking
climate and ocean processes to spatial and temporal variability in productivity
of North American Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) populations. In the first
two chapters, I use a macro-scale perspective to examine the effects of two
alternative bottom-up forcing pathways on salmon productivity across a variety
of systems. This cross-scale comparative approach has the advantage of allowing
the simultaneous estimation of environmental effects at multiple spatial scales.
In the third chapter, I focus on the Northern California Current system to
examine the cumulative impacts of multiple ecological pathways linking climate
variability and salmon productivity through the use of ecological network
analysis. Finally, in the fourth chapter I use a policy perspective to examine
challenges, and solutions, to integrating highly migratory Pacific into
localized ecosystem-based management plans.

## Footnote definitions


[^2]: The term 'ecological pathway' is used throughout this thesis to describe a
      series of connected ecological processes (abiotic and/or biotic) where one
      process (e.g., dynamics of the spring phytoplankton bloom) is thought to
      be at least partially affected by the process directly prior to it in the
      pathway (e.g., water column stability).

## Intro results

Results from this chapter indicate that spring bloom dynamics can have a strong
effect on salmon productivity with the phenology of the bloom consistently being
a better predictor of salmon productivity than phytoplankton biomass. Thus,
chapter 1 provides some evidence that vertical transport processes that
influence phytoplankton phenology can strongly influence productivity of Pacific
salmon populations.

I find that stocks of these species in the southern part of their North American
range (i.e., throughout British Columbia and Washington) are most strongly
affected by variability in horizontal ocean transport and the effect attenuates
for stocks that enter the ocean at higher latitudes. Thus, chapter 2 provides
some evidence that horizontal transport processes can strongly influence
productivity of Pacific salmon populations in the southern part of their North
American range.

## Intro paragraph

Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations varies over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with 3-fold changes not being unusual.
For Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.), as well as several pelagic and
demersal marine fish species, three lines of evidence suggest that environmental
stochasticity is a leading driver of this variability in stock productivity, and
thereby the populations response to harvesting. First, paleo-ecological studies
have shown that fish populations experienced large fluctuations in abundance
prior to the onset of commercial fishing [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second,
within-stock density-dependent effects often explain little of the observed
variability in stock productivity [@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a; @Cury2014].
Finally, shifts in the underlying mean productivity of stocks often coincide
with environmental regime shifts [@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a;
@Rothschild2000a].  Despite these multiple lines of evidence, maintaining viable
and productive fish populations in the face of unprecedented environmental
change requires a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms driving the
observed variability in stock productivity.

The effects of environmental conditions, including abiotic (e.g., temperature,
climate) and biotic (e.g., prey availability, competition, and predation)
processes are largely hypothesized to influence survival of pre-recruit life
stages, and thus overall stock productivity [@Hare2014]. For example, the
critical-period hypothesis, first introduced by @Hjort1914, proposes that
year-class success is largely determined by prey availability when fish larvae
start exogenous feeding, i.e., mortality during this critical life stage due to
poor feeding conditions may disproportionately affect overall year-class
success. Since the seminal publication of @Hjort1914, dozens of alternative
hypotheses have been developed to explain the effects of environmental processes
on fish stock productivity including the match-mismatch hypothesis, the stable
ocean hypothesis, and the optimal environmental window hypothesis
[@Cushing1990a; @Cury1989a; @Peterman1987b; @Lasker1978]. A critical challenge
to estimating the effects of environmental processes on stock productivity is
separating the effects of these competing hypotheses.

[^1]: Throughout this thesis, the term productivity refers to the per capita
      growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
      number of recruits produced per spawner.

Among the sources of these uncertainties,

Uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of change in productivity of marine

  tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations
  being greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This

## Climatic Change Rewrite

- Environmental change, whether due to natural perturbations or anthropogenic
  sources, presents a significant challenge for


One of the central challenges in fisheries science is understanding how
environmental change influences demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish
populations [@Chavez2003a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Changes in climate systems over the
past five decades due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere have resulted in warmer mean atmosphere and ocean temperatures,
decreased snow and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns,
and increased ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these abiotic
ecosystem components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to millenia.
Equally rapid changes have also been observed for biological processes including
shifts in phenology, species distributions, and fish stock productivity.

In addition to anthropogenic climate change, changes in climate systems due to
natural variability can also strongly influence the structure and function of
marine and freshwater ecosystems, which are often termed regime shifts. For
example, a major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77 is one of the best documented
cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the dynamics of the North
Pacific. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the North
Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
flatfish-dominated system. Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon
(O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased by more
than 65% after the regime shift (Ruggerone et al. 2010).

While changes in large-spatial-scale climate patterns, such as the PDO, are
often correlated with indices of salmon productivity, there are many
intermediate-scale linkages between climate patterns and salmon productivity, as
well as multiple pathways that can connect climate and salmon [@Mueter2002a;
@Beamish2004b; @Drinkwater2010a]. For example, large-scale climate patterns are
assumed to influence coastal marine ecosystems by acting on local and
regional-scale physical variables such as sea surface temperature and ocean
circulation patterns (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). In turn, these physical variables
are thought to either influence or associate with biological components of the
ecosystem such as the spring phytoplankton bloom, composition of the zooplankton
community, and salmon growth rates (Cross et al. 2008; Keister et al. 2011). The
coupling among environmental processes within these pathways thus creates a
complex causal network that links climate patterns, ocean conditions, and salmon
population dynamics.

The early marine life-phase for Pacific salmon is often considered a critical
period, i.e., mortality during this life-stage has a disproportionately large
affect on overall stock productivity. Mortality of juvenile salmon in the ocean
is widely recognized to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a;
@McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a], with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., > 70%)
occurring during the first year of ocean residency [@Parker1968a;
@Peterman1985a; @Beamish2001a; @Wertheimer2007a]. During this critical period,
food resources, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be
important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity,
indicating that processes regulating food resource availability likely have a
strong impact on individual stock productivities, and may be a key driver of
spatial synchrony in productivity across stocks [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

A prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis in marine ecosystems posits that
vertical transport processes modulates surface primary production. In
particular, processes controlling water column stratification and the movement
of deep nutrient rich water to the surface are frequently cited as key elements
driving phytoplankton dynamics. For example, in coastal upwelling areas, winds
drive surface waters offshore through Ekman dynamics, causing deep nutrient rich
water to upwell into the photic zone, providing the necessary nutrients for
primary production. In turn, this primary production provides grazing
opportunities for zooplankton, and thus provides a pathway between vertical
ocean transport and salmon productivity.

Recently, an alternative bottom-up forcing hypothesis has emerged that suggests
that horizontal ocean transport may be as equally important as vertical
transport in determining productivity of higher-trophic-level species. The
horizontal transport hypothesis suggests that food resources available to
juvenile salmon is driven by changes in horizontal transport processes, e.g.,
ocean currents or eddies, that cause zooplankton or other weakly/passive
drifters to be advected into or out of coastal areas. For example, in the
California Current, research has indicated that the composition of copepods in
coastal areas is largely determined by advection processes.

   underlying mean productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental
   regime shifts [@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a; @Rothschild2000a].

3. It is widely recognized that the dynamics of the North Pacific are partially
   controlled by inter-decadal fluctuations in large-scale climate and ocean
   processes [@Mantua1997a; @Hare1999a]. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
   and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) represent two of the major
   modes of large-scale variability in the North Pacific [@Mantua2002a;
   @Di-Lorenzo2008a]. Fluctuations in these patterns, often referred to as
   regime shifts, can substantially alter the physical and biological processes
   in the North Pacific [@Chavez2003a]. A major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77
   is one of the best documented cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the
   dynamics of the North Pacific [@Mantua1997a; @Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a;
   @Hunt2002a]. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the
   North Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
   flatfish-dominated system [@Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a]. Moreover, the
   abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon and pink salmon in the North Pacific
   increased by more than 65% after the regime shift [@Ruggerone2010a].

   on local and regional-scale physical variables such as sea surface
   temperature and ocean circulation patterns (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). In turn,
   these physical variables are thought to either influence or associate with
   biological components of the ecosystem such as the spring phytoplankton
   bloom, composition of the zooplankton community, and salmon growth rates
   (Cross et al. 2008; Keister et al. 2011). The coupling among environmental
   processes within these pathways thus creates a complex causal network that
   links climate patterns, ocean conditions, and salmon population dynamics.

5. Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across

   an important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of

   @Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the hypothesized
   drivers of the population dynamics should approximately match the observed
   extent of synchrony across populations. For example, Pacific salmon
   productivity trends tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with
   synchrony among populations being greatest at distances less than 500 km
   [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This provides a first suggestion that
   regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are likely drivers of salmon
   productivity.

6. Synchronous environmental conditions have long been cited as a likely
   mechanism driving spatial synchrony in animal populations. Although the Moran
   effect was originally formulated using abiotic factors (e.g., temperature),
   it is now often broadened to also include biotic factors such as food
   resource availability.  For Pacific salmon, mortality during the ocean life
   phase is widely recognized to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a;
   @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a], with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., >

   period, food resources, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been
   shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as
   productivity, indicating that processes regulating food resource availability

## Intro paragraphs

One of the central challenges in fisheries science is understanding how
environmental change influences productivity[^1] of marine and anadromous fish
populations [@Chavez2003a; @Vert-pre2013a].

Widespread changes in productivity have been observed for numerous demersal
and pelagic fish stocks (e.g., Pacific salmon, sardines, and Atlantic cod), with
order of magnitude productivity shifts not being unusual.

Indeed, spatially coherent environmental have long been cited as a likely
mechanism driving spatial synchrony in animal populations.


Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations varies over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with three-fold changes not being unusual.

These shifts in productivity can be abrupt and persistent such as the three-fold
changes in productivity

or occur gradually
over decades. For example, following the 1976/77 climatic regime shift in the
North Pacific, productivity of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon increased three-fold.


"increasing management or conservation risks if the shifts are not anticipated
or detected quickly because fisheries may need to adapt to lower, or higher,
potential yields"

For Pacific salmon, a key determinate of a populations response to harvesting is
the productivity of the population, which varies over time and space, with
three-fold changes not being unusual.

For Pacific salmon, the early marine life phase is often considered a critical
period with evidence suggesting that mortality rates during the first year of
ocean residency may exceed xx%.

, such as the three-fold increase in
productivity in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon following the

Such large changes in stock productivity creates challenges for managers and
stakeholders because productivity is a key determinate of a populations response
to harvesting.


## Environmental change + stock productivity
- Key point: competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to
  environmental change

Not include environmental effects in assessments:
  1. confounding with fishing effects
  2. no mechanistic understanding
  3. non-stationarity of environmental processes
  4. increase uncertainty in assessments

Although both top-down and bottom-up regulated processes have been hypothesized
to link environmental variability and fish stock productivity, for Pacific
salmon, most of the research has focused on bottom-up forcing processes.
Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a; @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a].
Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced mortality rates
compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of marine mortality of
salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the first year of ocean
residency, indicating that growth rates during this period are particularly
important for determining stock productivity [@Parker1968a; @Peterman1985a;
@Beamish2001a; @Wertheimer2007a] During this critical period, foraging
conditions, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be
important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity,
indicating that bottom-up forcing mechanisms likely have a strong impact on
Pacific salmon year class strength [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

Although these three lines of evidence provide a first suggestion of the
importance of environmental stochasticity on higher-trophic-level species, being
able to anticipate and quickly detect shifts in productivity owing to
environmental changes requires a quantitative understanding of how environmental
stochasticity affects higher-trophic-level species.

Physical (e.g. temperature, nutrients) and biological (e.g. prey availability,
competition and predation) processes in marine ecosystems impact fish stock
productivity and food availability through bottom-up forcing processes.

Estimating the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
processes including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a].

The effects of environmental stochasticity on these ecological processes of
productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental conditions
can have widespread effects across many drivers.

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a].

The effects of environmental stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are
not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental conditions can have
widespread effects across many drivers. For example, changes in ocean
temperature may simultaneously influence the distribution of predator
populations and the availability of food resources. Furthermore, environmental
conditions may also have direct effects on fish populations, for example, by
influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and reproduction [CITE].
Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects fish populations
requires understanding the relative importance of competing hypotheses of how
fish populations respond to environmental change.

Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations vary over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with 10-fold changes not being unusual.
Despite more than 100 years of research, there are still large uncertainties
about the underlying drivers of this variability. These uncertainties create
risks for management agencies, fish stocks, and communities that rely on these
fish populations for economic and cultural prosperity.  For example, abrupt and
persistent changes in the productivity of an exploited fish stock can have
important management and conservation implications if they are not anticipated
or detected quickly because they can mislead scientists and decision-makers
about the status of a stock or appropriate management actions to take
[@Walters1987a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Fundamental to minimizing these risks is
development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability.

[^1] Throughout this thesis, the term productivity refers to the per capita
growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
number of recruits produced per spawner.

It is widely recognized that variability in the structure and function of marine
ecosystems, is in part, driven by environmental stochasticity. However, the
effects of environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level fish species has
been, and continues to be, debated in fisheries science [@Walters1988a;
@Skud1975]. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations. In many cases,
separating the effects of fishing and environmental stochasticity may not be
possible without extreme management actions, which are usually not politically
feasible [@Walters2004b, pg. 176-177]. In all but a few cases, the confounding
of fishing and environmental effects has resulted in ignoring the effects of
environmental stochasticity on fish stock productivity. However, in the face of
unprecedented environmental change, continuing to ignore environment effects may
be costly from an economic, management, and ecological perspective.

Two leading hypotheses are widely used to explain fluctuations in abundance, (1)
environmental effects on pre-recruit life stages, and (2) effects of fishing
mortality and the size of the spawning stock.

The processes driving fluctuations in abundance have been widely debated in
fisheries science

A leading hypothesis used to explain fluctuations in adult abundances posits
that variability in abundance can largely be explained by processes affecting
survival of pre-recruit life stages such as prey availability, predation,
dispersal, and growth.

Two general hypotheses are widely used to explain fluctuations in adult
abundances. The first hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes
affecting survival in pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability,
predation, dispersal, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and
recruitment, focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery.

Fundamental to minimizing this risk is having the ability to anticipate and
quickly detect the effects of ecological perturbations on productivity of
exploited fish stocks. Stock productivity, i.e., the per capita population
growth rate, affects a populations response to harvesting and environmental
change, and also affects the speed of recovery from depletion. Thus, development
of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed variability in
stock productivity is critical for maintaining viable and productive fish
populations in the face of unprecedented environmental change

It is widely recognized that variability in the structure and function of marine
ecosystems, is in part, driven by environmental stochasticity. For example,
following a reversal of Pacific Decadal Oscillation in 1976/77, the
community composition in the North Pacific shifted from a
crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and flatfish-dominated system
[@Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a]. Similarly, following this 1976/77 regime
shift, productivity of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon increased nearly
three-fold.

Since the seminal publication of Hjort (1914), four general hypotheses have
been used to explain variability in productivity of marine and anadromous
fish stocks

Despite such compelling evidence for the effects of
environmental variability on higher-trophic-level fish species, the relative
importance of  environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations has been widely
debated in fisheries science.

Despite compelling evidence indicating the
potential for strong effects of environmental stochasticity on marine and
anadromous stock productivities,

Disentangling the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,
changes in environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many
drivers. For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence
the distribution of predator populations and the availability of food
resources. Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on
fish populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds,
and reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change
affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of
competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.

Over the past 100 years, four general hypotheses have been used to
explain variability in fish stock abundances. including year-class success,
fishing and recruitment, and adult trophic interactions. The first
hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes affecting the
pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability, predation, dispersal,
physiology, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and recruitment,
largely focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery. The third
hypothesis, adult trophic interactions, focuses on the ecosystem level and
how prey and predation of adults influences abundances.

Because productivity affects a populations response to harvesting and
environmental change, and also affects the speed of recovery from depletion,
development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability in stock productivity is essential for maintaining viable and
productive fish populations in the face of unprecedented environmental change

understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per capita population
growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a populations
response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects the speed of

Despite a century of research, much uncertainty remains in our understanding of

Productivity Footnote:
In particular, understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per
capita population growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a
populations response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects
the speed of recovery from depletion. For many exploited fish stocks,
within-stock density-dependent effects only explain a small fraction of the
observed variability in productivity, suggesting that environmental influences
are important.

For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an
unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the
effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the
collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery [@Pershing2015]. Thus, avoiding
similar undesirable management outcomes in the future will likely require
understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact marine and
anadromous fish populations.

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations is understanding how environmental stochasticity affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Although it is widely recognized
that variability in the structure and function of marine ecosystems, is in part,
driven by environmental stochasticity, the effects of environmental conditions
on higher-trophic-level species has been, and continues to be, debated in
fisheries science [@Walters1988a; @Skud1975]. At the core of the debate is
contention over the relative importance of environmental stochasticity and the
effects of fishing in controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations.
For Pacific salmon, at least three lines of evidence suggest that environmental
stochasticity is indeed a leading driver of variability in stock productivity.
First, paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations experienced
large fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial fishing
[@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent effects
often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
[@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a]. Finally, shifts in the underlying mean
productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental regime shifts
[@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a].

Although these three lines of evidence provide a first suggestion of the
importance of environmental stochasticity, in many cases, separating the effects
of fishing and environmental stochasticity on exploited populations may not be
possible without extreme management actions [@Walters2004b, pg. 176-177].
However, ignoring the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish stock
productivity may be costly from an economic, management and ecological
perspective. For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been
increasing at an unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to
account for the effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely
contributed to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery [@Pershing2015].
Thus, avoiding similar undesirable management outcomes in the future will likely
require understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact
marine and anadromous fish populations.

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,
changes in environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many
drivers. For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence
the distribution of predator populations and the availability of food

affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of

For example, abrupt and persistent changes in the productivity of an exploited
fish stock can increase management and conservation risks if the changes are not
anticipated or quickly detected because they can mislead managers about the
status of a stock or appropriate management actions to take [@Walters1987a;
@Vert-pre2013a]

Indeed, responses of marine and anadromous fish populations to changes in
environmental conditions have been widely observed and may impact fisheries
management outcomes.

The first and most famous case of these contentions was the Thompson-Burkenroad
debate of the mid twentieth century where the relative importance of fishing
effects and environmental stochasticity in controlling Pacific halibut
abundances was publicly debated. In this particular case, both hypotheses (i.e.,
fishing effects and environmental conditions) explained the observed variability
in the data equally well causing the debate to last into the present century.

Therefore, understanding the drivers of the variability in productivity is
critical for anticipating how perturbations to the marine ecosystem will impact
salmon populations.

Anticipating how perturbations to marine ecosystems will impact marine and
anadromous fish populations requires the ability to quickly detect

- Productivity is important because:
  - Affects population response to harvesting and environmental change
  - Affects the speed of recovery from depletion

- Lines of evidence for environmental effects:
  - 500 years of fluctuations
  - Recruitment poorly explained by spawner abundance
  - Regional and multi-regional spatial covariation

- relationships between spawner abundance and recruitment get obscured from
  environmental stochasticity [@Szuwalski2015a].

- "even small changes in survival can result in highly variable year class
  sizes" [@Szuwalski2015a].

- "if environmental forcing is non-stationary ... productivity inferred from
  data collected in the past may not be relevant today" [@Szuwalski2015a].

Two common assumptions in fisheries science are that (1) stocks productivity is
positively related to the size of the spawning stock and (2) this productivity
function is constant through time (i.e., productivity is stationary). Recent
evidence, however, suggest that these two assumption may be incorrect. For
example, non-stationarity in productivity has been observed for a wide range of
pelagic and demersal fish species including Pacific salmon, Pacific herring,
sardines, and Atlantic cod. Similarly, global meta-analyses have indicated that
the majority of exploited fish populations do not show a positive relationship
between spawning stock size and recruitment.

A central problem in fisheries science is understanding how environmental change
influences demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations. In
particular, understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per
capita population growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a
populations response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects
the speed of recovery from depletion. For many exploited fish stocks,
within-stock density-dependent effects only explain a small fraction of the
observed variability in productivity, suggesting that environmental influences
are important.

As the climate warms, maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations will require the ability to anticipate how ecological
perturbations affect stock productivity.  Anthropogenic climate change is
already resulting in warmer atmosphere and ocean temperatures, decreased snow
and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased
ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these abiotic ecosystem
components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to millenia. Changes in
climate systems have also had many biological effects including changes in
phenology, species distribution, and fish stock productivity.  For example,
ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an unprecedented
rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the effects of this
warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the collapse of the Gulf
of Maine cod fishery.

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and
anadromous fish populations is understanding how environmental change affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Changes in climate systems over
the past five decades due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere have resulted in warmer mean atmosphere and ocean temperatures,
decreased snow and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns,
and increased ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these
abiotic ecosystem components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to
millenia. Equally rapid changes have also been observed for biological
processes including shifts in phenology, species distributions, and fish stock
productivity.

In addition to anthropogenic climate change, changes in climate systems due to
natural variability can also strongly influence the structure and function of
marine and freshwater ecosystems, which are often termed regime shifts. For
example, a major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77 is one of the best documented
cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the dynamics of the North
Pacific. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the North
Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
flatfish-dominated system. Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon
(O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased by more
than 65% after the regime shift (Ruggerone et al. 2010).


## Spatial variability
Four mechanisms are frequently reported to explain spatial synchrony across
populations.
  - Dispersal
  - Predators
  - Food
  - Environment
  - Disease???


Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across space
and determining the extent of spatial synchrony across populations is an
important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of how
abiotic and biotic factors drive local population dynamics [@Koenig1999a;
@Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the hypothesized drivers
of the population dynamics should approximately match the observed extent of
synchrony across populations. For example, Pacific salmon productivity trends
tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations
being greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This
provides a first suggestion that regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are
likely drivers of salmon productivity.

Four processes have been hypothesized to drive spatial synchrony in animal
populations including dispersal, disease, predation, and environmental
stochasticity [@Koenig1999a; @Bjornstad1999a].  For Pacific salmon, dispersal
occurs when adults from one population stray from their natal spawning area and
reproduce with another population. Although salmon dispersal plays an important
role in meta-population dynamics, dispersal rates are likely too low to
synchronize populations across 100's of kilometers [@Schtickzelle2007;
@Brenner2012; @Rogers2008]. In some areas, predation and host/parasite dynamics
may be contributing factors to spatial synchrony across salmon populations. For
example, along the southern British Columbia coast, infection of wild salmon
with sea lice from Atlantic salmon farms has been shown to reduce population
growth for wild pink and coho salmon population that migrate past the salmon
farms [@Connors2010; @Krkosek2011]. Similarly, mobile predators such as birds,
and marine mammals predate salmon across numerous populations, although it is
unclear if predation rates from these predators are high enough to cause
synchrony across population [@Ford2016; @Springer2014].  However, in many areas
(e.g., Alaska) the prevalence of disease and spatial extent of predation within
and across populations is largely unknown due to the lack of pertinent data,
making it difficult to estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms in
driving the observed spatial synchrony.

Synchronous environmental conditions have long been cited as a likely mechanism
driving spatial synchrony in animal populations. Although the Moran effect was
originally formulated using abiotic factors (e.g., temperature), it is now often
broadened to also include biotic factors such as food resource availability.
For Pacific salmon, mortality during the ocean life phase is widely recognized
to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a; @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a],
with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., > 70%) occurring during the first
year of ocean residency [@Parker1968a; @Peterman1985a; @Beamish2001a;
@Wertheimer2007a].  During this critical period, food resources, and in
particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be important factors in
determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity, indicating that
processes regulating food resource availability likely have a strong impact on
individual stock productivities, and may be a key driver of spatial synchrony in
productivity across stocks [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

## Multiple working hypotheses

Over the past 100 years, three primary hypotheses have been put forward to
explain variability in fish stock abundances including year-class success,
fishing and recruitment, and adult trophic interactions. The first
hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes affecting the
pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability, predation, dispersal,
physiology, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and recruitment,
largely focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery. The third
hypothesis, adult trophic interactions, focuses on the ecosystem level and
how prey and predation of adults influences abundances.

Hypotheses to explain variability in abundances and distribution of
exploited fish species:
  1. year-class success
     - parental condition
     - prey availability
     - dispersal
     - predation
     - growth
  2. fishing and recruitment
     - spawning stock size
     - fishing intensity/exploitation rate
  3. adult trophic interactions
     - predation of adults
     - adult prey availability
  4. migration/movement
     - variable movement/migration affects availability to fishery/surveys


The first of these hypotheses is largely the purview of fisheries oceanography
and focuses on the processes affecting the pre-recruit life stages. The second
hypothesis, fishing and recruitment, is largely the purview of fisheries science
and

[^2] there is also a fourth hypothesis, migration/movement, however this
hypothesis mainly deals with the availability of fish to a fishery and
assumes that abundance is relatively constant.

- multiple factors/hypotheses
- cumulative effects
- strength of evidence
- sequential (in series) vs. parallel factors/hypotheses

Simultaneously investigating multiple competing hypotheses is a hallmark of the
Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses first outlined in 1890 by
T.C. Chamberlin. In this seminal paper, Chamberlin warned that "We are so prone
to attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an agency
present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to recognize that
it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in the accomplishment of the
total result." To overcome the trap of the 'ruling hypothesis' he suggests

The idea of simultaneously investigating multiple competing hypotheses was
first introduced by the 19th century geologist T.C. Chamberlin. Chamberlin
outlined the method of multiple working hypotheses, which he defined as

In fisheries science, identifying causative factors of observed phenomena,
such as changes in stock productivity, is exceedingly difficult because
there is often evidence for more than one hypothesis.

  - A leading hypothesis of how bottom-up forcing can influence
    higher-trophic-level species such as salmon starts with physical
    oceanographic conditions, and in particular vertical transport of
    nutrients into the upper water column.

A key assumption of this previous work on the links between vertical transport
and productivity of higher-trophic-level species is that there is a strong
relationship between phytoplankton dynamics and salmon productivity, however,
this assumption is largely untested. In the Northeast Pacific, phytoplankton
dynamics are primarily characterized by the spring phytoplankton bloom, which
has two primary modes of variability, the timing of the bloom and the intensity
of the bloom [CITE]. In chapter xxx, I explore the relationships between spring
bloom dynamics and salmon productivity by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity. I find strong evidence for effects of the timing of the spring
bloom as well as phytoplankton biomass following the bloom on salmon
productivity throughout the North Pacific Rim.

  higher-trophic-level species such as salmon starts with physical oceanographic

- For example, in coastal upwelling areas winds drive surface water offshore
  through Ekman transport, which brings cool nutrient rich water into the photic

- To get around this, previous research has relied on physical oceanographic
  data, for example, by estimating relationships between upwelling intensity and
  salmon productivity

- But, with the advent of remote sensing satellites, we are now able to
  investigate relationships between phytoplankton and salmon productivity, which
  gets us one step closer.

- There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food resources
  available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes in horizontal
  transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton to be adverted
  into or out of coastal areas

For instance, @Nickelson1986a and @Logerwell2003a showed positive relationships
between average upwelling intensity and marine survival of coho salmon in the
Northern California Current, whereas @Pearcy1997 and @Botsford2002 provided
evidence that this relationship may be non-stationary through time.  juvenile
salmon in coastal habitats

In chapter 1, I explore this assumption by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity. If phytoplankton dynamics are an important driver of salmon
productivity we should expect the spatial scale of variability in phytoplankton
dynamics to match those of salmon productivity. I test this expectation using a
series of non-parametric covariance models to estimate the distance of spatial
covariation for the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, chl-a biomass, and
pink salmon productivity. I find strong evidence for a match in spatial
covariation between the phytoplankton dynamics and pink salmon productivity,
which provides a first indication.

The results of this research have been mixed with some studies indicating
positive relationships between productivity and upwelling intensity and others
indicated no relationship.

- Horizontal transport (ch. 2)
  - There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food
    resources available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes in
    horizontal transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton
    to be advected into or out of coastal areas.

  - Since zooplankton, along with many other items consumed by juvenile salmon,
    are passive drifters, it suggests that ocean currents may play a role in
    determining foraging conditions of juvenile salmon during the early marine
    life phase. Ocean currents also represent an important intermediate link
    between atmospheric conditions and biological productivity (Brodeur and Ware
    1992; Keister et al. 2011).

  - Because the proliferation of this horizontal ocean transport hypothesis is
    fairly new, it has not be tested beyond a few local scale studies. In
    chapter 2, I explore explore the effects of the dominate

- Multiple mechanisms (ch. 3)
  - The two previously discussed hypotheses for how bottom-up forcing may drive
    salmon productivity are not mutually exclusive and both likely play a role
    in determining year-class strength. Therefore, understanding the relative
    importance of these separate ecological pathways is necessary to increase
    our ability to anticipate how ecological perturbations affect salmon
    populations.

## Managing for environmental change (ch. 4)

A better understanding of how environmental forcing impacts salmon populations
is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining viable and
productive salmon stocks. We also need to develop a parallel understanding of
how these impacts interact with other anthropogenic disturbances, such as
commercial harvesting, and how this information can be incorporated into
management decisions [@Link2002a]. Increasingly, management of living marine
resources is moving toward ecosystem-based approaches to management that shift
the focus of management from a single-species to maintaining critical components
of ecosystem structure and function [@Grumbine1994; @Murawski2007a; @Long2015].
Implementing ecosystem-based management approaches requires defining boundaries
that delimit the spatial extent of the decision-making process and most of the
research examining the challenges to implementing ecosystem-based management
assume that the anthropogenic (or natural) disturbances occur within the human
defined boundaries of the decision-making area [@Engler2015; @Yaffee1999].
However, for highly migratory marine and anadromous fish species, these impacts
can occur across a continuum of spatial scales that frequently extend beyond the
boundaries of the ecosystem-based management area [@Dallimer2015]. For example,
management actions, such as decisions to increased commercial harvest, in
locations that are geographically distance from the ecosystem-based management
area may strongly impact the supply of ecosystem services provided by a
migratory species within the bounds of the ecosystem-based management area. In
chapter 4, I confront this assumption by examining challenges associated with
integrating highly migratory Pacific salmon into regional and local scale
ecosystem-based management policies and outline potential strategies to overcome
the challenges.

  stochasticity, there continues to be deep uncertainties about the effects of
  environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level species.

- For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at
  an unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for
  the effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to
  the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery [@Pershing2015]. Thus, avoiding

  understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact marine and

  paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations experienced large
  fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial fishing
  [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent effects

  [@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a; @Cury2014]. Finally, shifts in the

# Research overview

In this thesis, I aim to add to that quantitative understanding by using a
cross-system comparative approach to examine ecological pathways[^2] linking
climate and ocean processes to spatial and temporal variability in productivity
of North American Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) populations. In the first
two chapters, I use a macro-scale perspective to examine the effects of two
alternative bottom-up forcing pathways on salmon productivity across a variety
of systems. This cross-scale comparative approach has the advantage of allowing
the simultaneous estimation of environmental effects at multiple spatial scales.
In the third chapter, I focus on the Northern California Current system to
examine the cumulative impacts of multiple ecological pathways linking climate
variability and salmon productivity through the use of ecological network
analysis. Finally, in the fourth chapter I use a policy perspective to examine
challenges, and solutions, to integrating highly migratory Pacific into
localized ecosystem-based management plans.

# Footnote definitions

[^1]: Throughout this thesis, the term productivity refers to the per capita
      growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
      number of recruits produced per spawner.

[^2]: The term 'ecological pathway' is used throughout this thesis to describe a
      series of connected ecological processes (abiotic and/or biotic) where one
      process (e.g., dynamics of the spring phytoplankton bloom) is thought to
      be at least partially affected by the process directly prior to it in the
      pathway (e.g., water column stability).

# Intro results

Results from this chapter indicate that spring bloom dynamics can have a strong
effect on salmon productivity with the phenology of the bloom consistently being
a better predictor of salmon productivity than phytoplankton biomass. Thus,
chapter 1 provides some evidence that vertical transport processes that
influence phytoplankton phenology can strongly influence productivity of Pacific
salmon populations.

I find that stocks of these species in the southern part of their North American
range (i.e., throughout British Columbia and Washington) are most strongly
affected by variability in horizontal ocean transport and the effect attenuates
for stocks that enter the ocean at higher latitudes. Thus, chapter 2 provides
some evidence that horizontal transport processes can strongly influence
productivity of Pacific salmon populations in the southern part of their North
American range.

# Intro paragraph

Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations varies over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with 3-fold changes not being unusual.
For Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.), as well as several pelagic and
demersal marine fish species, three lines of evidence suggest that environmental
stochasticity is a leading driver of this variability in stock productivity, and
thereby the populations response to harvesting. First, paleo-ecological studies
have shown that fish populations experienced large fluctuations in abundance
prior to the onset of commercial fishing [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second,
within-stock density-dependent effects often explain little of the observed
variability in stock productivity [@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a; @Cury2014].
Finally, shifts in the underlying mean productivity of stocks often coincide
with environmental regime shifts [@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a;
@Rothschild2000a].  Despite these multiple lines of evidence, maintaining viable
and productive fish populations in the face of unprecedented environmental
change requires a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms driving the
observed variability in stock productivity.

The effects of environmental conditions, including abiotic (e.g., temperature,
climate) and biotic (e.g., prey availability, competition, and predation)
processes are largely hypothesized to influence survival of pre-recruit life
stages, and thus overall stock productivity [@Hare2014]. For example, the
critical-period hypothesis, first introduced by @Hjort1914, proposes that
year-class success is largely determined by prey availability when fish larvae
start exogenous feeding, i.e., mortality during this critical life stage due to
poor feeding conditions may disproportionately affect overall year-class
success. Since the seminal publication of @Hjort1914, dozens of alternative
hypotheses have been developed to explain the effects of environmental processes
on fish stock productivity including the match-mismatch hypothesis, the stable
ocean hypothesis, and the optimal environmental window hypothesis
[@Cushing1990a; @Cury1989a; @Peterman1987b; @Lasker1978]. A critical challenge
to estimating the effects of environmental processes on stock productivity is
separating the effects of these competing hypotheses.

      growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
      number of recruits produced per spawner.

fundamental challenge of managing living marine resources.

Among the sources of these uncertainties,

Uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of change in productivity of marine

  of the population dynamics should approximately match the observed extent of
  synchrony across populations. For example, Pacific salmon productivity trends
  tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations
  being greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This

# Climatic Change Rewrite

- Environmental change, whether due to natural perturbations or anthropogenic
  sources, presents a significant challenge for


One of the central challenges in fisheries science is understanding how
environmental change influences demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish
populations [@Chavez2003a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Changes in climate systems over the
past five decades due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere have resulted in warmer mean atmosphere and ocean temperatures,
decreased snow and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns,
and increased ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these abiotic
ecosystem components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to millenia.
Equally rapid changes have also been observed for biological processes including
shifts in phenology, species distributions, and fish stock productivity.

In addition to anthropogenic climate change, changes in climate systems due to
natural variability can also strongly influence the structure and function of
marine and freshwater ecosystems, which are often termed regime shifts. For
example, a major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77 is one of the best documented
cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the dynamics of the North
Pacific. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the North
Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
flatfish-dominated system. Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon
(O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased by more
than 65% after the regime shift (Ruggerone et al. 2010).

While changes in large-spatial-scale climate patterns, such as the PDO, are
often correlated with indices of salmon productivity, there are many
intermediate-scale linkages between climate patterns and salmon productivity, as
well as multiple pathways that can connect climate and salmon [@Mueter2002a;
@Beamish2004b; @Drinkwater2010a]. For example, large-scale climate patterns are
assumed to influence coastal marine ecosystems by acting on local and
regional-scale physical variables such as sea surface temperature and ocean
circulation patterns (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). In turn, these physical variables
are thought to either influence or associate with biological components of the
ecosystem such as the spring phytoplankton bloom, composition of the zooplankton
community, and salmon growth rates (Cross et al. 2008; Keister et al. 2011). The
coupling among environmental processes within these pathways thus creates a
complex causal network that links climate patterns, ocean conditions, and salmon
population dynamics.

The early marine life-phase for Pacific salmon is often considered a critical
period, i.e., mortality during this life-stage has a disproportionately large
affect on overall stock productivity. Mortality of juvenile salmon in the ocean
is widely recognized to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a;
@McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a], with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., > 70%)
occurring during the first year of ocean residency [@Parker1968a;
@Peterman1985a; @Beamish2001a; @Wertheimer2007a]. During this critical period,
food resources, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be
important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity,
indicating that processes regulating food resource availability likely have a
strong impact on individual stock productivities, and may be a key driver of
spatial synchrony in productivity across stocks [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

A prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis in marine ecosystems posits that
vertical transport processes modulates surface primary production. In
particular, processes controlling water column stratification and the movement
of deep nutrient rich water to the surface are frequently cited as key elements
driving phytoplankton dynamics. For example, in coastal upwelling areas, winds
drive surface waters offshore through Ekman dynamics, causing deep nutrient rich
water to upwell into the photic zone, providing the necessary nutrients for
primary production. In turn, this primary production provides grazing
opportunities for zooplankton, and thus provides a pathway between vertical
ocean transport and salmon productivity.

Recently, an alternative bottom-up forcing hypothesis has emerged that suggests
that horizontal ocean transport may be as equally important as vertical
transport in determining productivity of higher-trophic-level species. The
horizontal transport hypothesis suggests that food resources available to
juvenile salmon is driven by changes in horizontal transport processes, e.g.,
ocean currents or eddies, that cause zooplankton or other weakly/passive
drifters to be advected into or out of coastal areas. For example, in the
California Current, research has indicated that the composition of copepods in
coastal areas is largely determined by advection processes.

   environmental stochasticity is a leading driver of this variability in stock
   productivity, and thereby the populations response to harvesting. First,

   underlying mean productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental
   regime shifts [@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a; @Rothschild2000a].

3. It is widely recognized that the dynamics of the North Pacific are partially
   controlled by inter-decadal fluctuations in large-scale climate and ocean
   processes [@Mantua1997a; @Hare1999a]. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
   and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) represent two of the major
   modes of large-scale variability in the North Pacific [@Mantua2002a;
   @Di-Lorenzo2008a]. Fluctuations in these patterns, often referred to as
   regime shifts, can substantially alter the physical and biological processes
   in the North Pacific [@Chavez2003a]. A major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77
   is one of the best documented cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the
   dynamics of the North Pacific [@Mantua1997a; @Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a;
   @Hunt2002a]. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the
   North Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
   flatfish-dominated system [@Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a]. Moreover, the
   abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon and pink salmon in the North Pacific
   increased by more than 65% after the regime shift [@Ruggerone2010a].

   bloom, composition of the zooplankton community, and salmon growth rates
   (Cross et al. 2008; Keister et al. 2011). The coupling among environmental
   processes within these pathways thus creates a complex causal network that
   links climate patterns, ocean conditions, and salmon population dynamics.

5. Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across

   drivers of the population dynamics should approximately match the observed
   extent of synchrony across populations. For example, Pacific salmon
   productivity trends tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with
   synchrony among populations being greatest at distances less than 500 km
   [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This provides a first suggestion that
   regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are likely drivers of salmon
   productivity.

6. Synchronous environmental conditions have long been cited as a likely
   mechanism driving spatial synchrony in animal populations. Although the Moran
   effect was originally formulated using abiotic factors (e.g., temperature),
   it is now often broadened to also include biotic factors such as food
   resource availability.  For Pacific salmon, mortality during the ocean life
   phase is widely recognized to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a;
   @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a], with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., >

   period, food resources, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been
   shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as
   productivity, indicating that processes regulating food resource availability

# Intro paragraphs

One of the central challenges in fisheries science is understanding how
environmental change influences productivity[^1] of marine and anadromous fish
populations [@Chavez2003a; @Vert-pre2013a].

Widespread changes in productivity have been observed for numerous demersal
and pelagic fish stocks (e.g., Pacific salmon, sardines, and Atlantic cod), with
order of magnitude productivity shifts not being unusual.

Indeed, spatially coherent environmental have long been cited as a likely
mechanism driving spatial synchrony in animal populations.


Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations varies over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with three-fold changes not being unusual.

These shifts in productivity can be abrupt and persistent such as the three-fold
changes in productivity

or occur gradually
over decades. For example, following the 1976/77 climatic regime shift in the
North Pacific, productivity of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon increased three-fold.


"increasing management or conservation risks if the shifts are not anticipated
or detected quickly because fisheries may need to adapt to lower, or higher,
potential yields"

For Pacific salmon, a key determinate of a populations response to harvesting is
the productivity of the population, which varies over time and space, with
three-fold changes not being unusual.

For Pacific salmon, the early marine life phase is often considered a critical
period with evidence suggesting that mortality rates during the first year of
ocean residency may exceed xx%.

, such as the three-fold increase in
productivity in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon following the

Such large changes in stock productivity creates challenges for managers and
stakeholders because productivity is a key determinate of a populations response
to harvesting.


# Environmental change + stock productivity
- Key point: competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to
  environmental change

Not include environmental effects in assessments:
  1. confounding with fishing effects
  2. no mechanistic understanding
  3. non-stationarity of environmental processes
  4. increase uncertainty in assessments

Although both top-down and bottom-up regulated processes have been hypothesized
to link environmental variability and fish stock productivity, for Pacific
salmon, most of the research has focused on bottom-up forcing processes.
Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a; @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a].
Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced mortality rates
compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of marine mortality of
salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the first year of ocean
residency, indicating that growth rates during this period are particularly
important for determining stock productivity [@Parker1968a; @Peterman1985a;
@Beamish2001a; @Wertheimer2007a] During this critical period, foraging
conditions, and in particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be
important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity,
indicating that bottom-up forcing mechanisms likely have a strong impact on
Pacific salmon year class strength [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

Although these three lines of evidence provide a first suggestion of the
importance of environmental stochasticity on higher-trophic-level species, being
able to anticipate and quickly detect shifts in productivity owing to
environmental changes requires a quantitative understanding of how environmental
stochasticity affects higher-trophic-level species.

Physical (e.g. temperature, nutrients) and biological (e.g. prey availability,
competition and predation) processes in marine ecosystems impact fish stock
productivity and food availability through bottom-up forcing processes.

Estimating the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
processes including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a].

The effects of environmental stochasticity on these ecological processes of
productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental conditions
can have widespread effects across many drivers.

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a].

The effects of environmental stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are
not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental conditions can have
widespread effects across many drivers. For example, changes in ocean
temperature may simultaneously influence the distribution of predator
populations and the availability of food resources. Furthermore, environmental
conditions may also have direct effects on fish populations, for example, by
influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and reproduction [CITE].
Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects fish populations
requires understanding the relative importance of competing hypotheses of how
fish populations respond to environmental change.

Productivity[^1] of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations vary over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with 10-fold changes not being unusual.
Despite more than 100 years of research, there are still large uncertainties
about the underlying drivers of this variability. These uncertainties create
risks for management agencies, fish stocks, and communities that rely on these
fish populations for economic and cultural prosperity.  For example, abrupt and
persistent changes in the productivity of an exploited fish stock can have
important management and conservation implications if they are not anticipated
or detected quickly because they can mislead scientists and decision-makers
about the status of a stock or appropriate management actions to take
[@Walters1987a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Fundamental to minimizing these risks is
development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability.

[^1] Throughout this thesis, the term productivity refers to the per capita
growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
number of recruits produced per spawner.

It is widely recognized that variability in the structure and function of marine
ecosystems, is in part, driven by environmental stochasticity. However, the
effects of environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level fish species has
been, and continues to be, debated in fisheries science [@Walters1988a;
@Skud1975]. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations. In many cases,
separating the effects of fishing and environmental stochasticity may not be
possible without extreme management actions, which are usually not politically
feasible [@Walters2004b, pg. 176-177]. In all but a few cases, the confounding
of fishing and environmental effects has resulted in ignoring the effects of
environmental stochasticity on fish stock productivity. However, in the face of
unprecedented environmental change, continuing to ignore environment effects may
be costly from an economic, management, and ecological perspective.

Two leading hypotheses are widely used to explain fluctuations in abundance, (1)
environmental effects on pre-recruit life stages, and (2) effects of fishing
mortality and the size of the spawning stock.

The processes driving fluctuations in abundance have been widely debated in
fisheries science

A leading hypothesis used to explain fluctuations in adult abundances posits
that variability in abundance can largely be explained by processes affecting
survival of pre-recruit life stages such as prey availability, predation,
dispersal, and growth.

Two general hypotheses are widely used to explain fluctuations in adult
abundances. The first hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes
affecting survival in pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability,
predation, dispersal, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and
recruitment, focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery.

Fundamental to minimizing this risk is having the ability to anticipate and
quickly detect the effects of ecological perturbations on productivity of
exploited fish stocks. Stock productivity, i.e., the per capita population
growth rate, affects a populations response to harvesting and environmental
change, and also affects the speed of recovery from depletion. Thus, development
of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed variability in
stock productivity is critical for maintaining viable and productive fish
populations in the face of unprecedented environmental change

It is widely recognized that variability in the structure and function of marine
ecosystems, is in part, driven by environmental stochasticity. For example,
following a reversal of Pacific Decadal Oscillation in 1976/77, the
community composition in the North Pacific shifted from a
crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and flatfish-dominated system
[@Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a]. Similarly, following this 1976/77 regime
shift, productivity of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon increased nearly
three-fold.

Since the seminal publication of Hjort (1914), four general hypotheses have
been used to explain variability in productivity of marine and anadromous
fish stocks

Despite such compelling evidence for the effects of
environmental variability on higher-trophic-level fish species, the relative
importance of  environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations has been widely
debated in fisheries science.

Despite compelling evidence indicating the
potential for strong effects of environmental stochasticity on marine and
anadromous stock productivities,

Disentangling the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,
changes in environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many
drivers. For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence
the distribution of predator populations and the availability of food
resources. Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on
fish populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds,
and reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change
affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of
competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.

Over the past 100 years, four general hypotheses have been used to
explain variability in fish stock abundances. including year-class success,
fishing and recruitment, and adult trophic interactions. The first
hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes affecting the
pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability, predation, dispersal,
physiology, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and recruitment,
largely focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery. The third
hypothesis, adult trophic interactions, focuses on the ecosystem level and
how prey and predation of adults influences abundances.

Because productivity affects a populations response to harvesting and
environmental change, and also affects the speed of recovery from depletion,
development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability in stock productivity is essential for maintaining viable and
productive fish populations in the face of unprecedented environmental change

understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per capita population
growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a populations
response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects the speed of
recovery from depletion.

Despite a century of research, much uncertainty remains in our understanding of
the drivers of this variability in abundances and this uncertainty creates risks
for management agencies, fish stocks, and communities that rely on these fish
populations for economic and cultural prosperity.

Fundamental to minimizing these risks is development of a quantitative
understanding of the drivers of the observed variability. In particular,

Maintaining viable and productive fish populations in the face of unprecedented
environmental change requires the ability to anticipate and quickly detect the
effects of ecological perturbations on productivity of exploited fish stocks.

Abundances of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations vary over time
and space by orders of magnitude, with 10-fold changes not being
unusual. Despite a century of research, much uncertainty remains in our
understanding of the drivers of this variability in abundances and this
uncertainty creates risks for management agencies, fish stocks, and communities
that rely on these fish populations for economic and cultural prosperity.  For
example, over-exploitation (or under-exploitation) can occur if abrupt and
persistent changes in abundance are not anticipated or quickly detected by
scientist and managers. Fundamental to minimizing these risks is development of
a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed variability.  My
doctoral research aims to add to that understanding.

more than 100 years of research, there are still large uncertainties about the
underlying drivers of this variability. These uncertainties create risks for
management agencies, fish stocks, and communities that rely on these fish
populations for economic and cultural prosperity.  For example, abrupt and
persistent changes in the productivity of an exploited fish stock can have
important management and conservation implications if they are not anticipated
or detected quickly because they can mislead scientists and decision-makers
about the status of a stock or appropriate management actions to take
[@Walters1987a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Fundamental to minimizing these risks is
development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability.

Demographic rates of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations vary over
time and space by orders of magnitude, with 10-fold changes not being unusual.
Such large spatial and temporal variability in population dynamics creates risks
for management agencies, fish stocks, and communities that rely on these fish
populations for economic and cultural prosperity.  For example, abrupt changes
in the productivity of an exploited fish stock can have important management and
conservation implications if they are not detected quickly because they can
mislead managers about the status of a stock or appropriate management actions
to take [@Walters1987a; @Vert-pre2013a]. Fundamental to minimizing these risks
is development of a quantitative understanding of the drivers of the observed
variability in stock productivity.

Productivity Footnote:
In particular, understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per
capita population growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a
populations response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects
the speed of recovery from depletion. For many exploited fish stocks,
within-stock density-dependent effects only explain a small fraction of the
observed variability in productivity, suggesting that environmental influences
are important.

For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an
unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the
effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the
collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery [@Pershing2015]. Thus, avoiding
similar undesirable management outcomes in the future will likely require
understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact marine and
anadromous fish populations.

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations is understanding how environmental stochasticity affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Although it is widely recognized
that variability in the structure and function of marine ecosystems, is in part,
driven by environmental stochasticity, the effects of environmental conditions
on higher-trophic-level species has been, and continues to be, debated in
fisheries science [@Walters1988a; @Skud1975]. At the core of the debate is
contention over the relative importance of environmental stochasticity and the
effects of fishing in controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations.
For Pacific salmon, at least three lines of evidence suggest that environmental
stochasticity is indeed a leading driver of variability in stock productivity.
First, paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations experienced
large fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial fishing
[@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent effects
often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
[@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a]. Finally, shifts in the underlying mean
productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental regime shifts
[@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a].

Although these three lines of evidence provide a first suggestion of the
importance of environmental stochasticity, in many cases, separating the effects
of fishing and environmental stochasticity on exploited populations may not be
possible without extreme management actions [@Walters2004b, pg. 176-177].
However, ignoring the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish stock
productivity may be costly from an economic, management and ecological
perspective. For example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been
increasing at an unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to
account for the effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely

Thus, avoiding similar undesirable management outcomes in the future will likely
require understanding and anticipating how environmental change will impact
marine and anadromous fish populations.

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,

For example, abrupt and persistent changes in the productivity of an exploited
fish stock can increase management and conservation risks if the changes are not
anticipated or quickly detected because they can mislead managers about the
status of a stock or appropriate management actions to take [@Walters1987a;
@Vert-pre2013a]

Indeed, responses of marine and anadromous fish populations to changes in
environmental conditions have been widely observed and may impact fisheries
management outcomes.

The first and most famous case of these contentions was the Thompson-Burkenroad
debate of the mid twentieth century where the relative importance of fishing
effects and environmental stochasticity in controlling Pacific halibut
abundances was publicly debated. In this particular case, both hypotheses (i.e.,
fishing effects and environmental conditions) explained the observed variability
in the data equally well causing the debate to last into the present century.

Therefore, understanding the drivers of the variability in productivity is
critical for anticipating how perturbations to the marine ecosystem will impact
salmon populations.

Anticipating how perturbations to marine ecosystems will impact marine and
anadromous fish populations requires the ability to quickly detect

- Productivity is important because:
  - Affects population response to harvesting and environmental change
  - Affects the speed of recovery from depletion

- Lines of evidence for environmental effects:
  - 500 years of fluctuations
  - Recruitment poorly explained by spawner abundance
  - Regional and multi-regional spatial covariation

- relationships between spawner abundance and recruitment get obscured from
  environmental stochasticity [@Szuwalski2015a].

- "even small changes in survival can result in highly variable year class
  sizes" [@Szuwalski2015a].

- "if environmental forcing is non-stationary ... productivity inferred from
  data collected in the past may not be relevant today" [@Szuwalski2015a].

Two common assumptions in fisheries science are that (1) stocks productivity is
positively related to the size of the spawning stock and (2) this productivity
function is constant through time (i.e., productivity is stationary). Recent
evidence, however, suggest that these two assumption may be incorrect. For
example, non-stationarity in productivity has been observed for a wide range of
pelagic and demersal fish species including Pacific salmon, Pacific herring,
sardines, and Atlantic cod. Similarly, global meta-analyses have indicated that
the majority of exploited fish populations do not show a positive relationship
between spawning stock size and recruitment.

A central problem in fisheries science is understanding how environmental change
influences demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations. In
particular, understanding the drivers of stock productivity, i.e., the per
capita population growth rate, is important because stock productivity affects a
populations response to harvesting and environmental change, and also affects
the speed of recovery from depletion. For many exploited fish stocks,
within-stock density-dependent effects only explain a small fraction of the
observed variability in productivity, suggesting that environmental influences
are important.

As the climate warms, maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations will require the ability to anticipate how ecological
perturbations affect stock productivity.  Anthropogenic climate change is
already resulting in warmer atmosphere and ocean temperatures, decreased snow
and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased
ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these abiotic ecosystem
components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to millenia. Changes in
climate systems have also had many biological effects including changes in
phenology, species distribution, and fish stock productivity.  For example,
ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an unprecedented
rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the effects of this
warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the collapse of the Gulf
of Maine cod fishery.

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and
anadromous fish populations is understanding how environmental change affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Changes in climate systems over
the past five decades due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere have resulted in warmer mean atmosphere and ocean temperatures,
decreased snow and ice, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns,
and increased ocean acidification. The rate of change for many of these
abiotic ecosystem components is unprecedented at the scale of decades to
millenia. Equally rapid changes have also been observed for biological
processes including shifts in phenology, species distributions, and fish stock
productivity.

In addition to anthropogenic climate change, changes in climate systems due to
natural variability can also strongly influence the structure and function of
marine and freshwater ecosystems, which are often termed regime shifts. For
example, a major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77 is one of the best documented
cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the dynamics of the North
Pacific. Following this regime shift, the species composition of the North
Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and
flatfish-dominated system. Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon
(O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased by more
than 65% after the regime shift (Ruggerone et al. 2010).


# Spatial variability
Four mechanisms are frequently reported to explain spatial synchrony across
populations.
  - Dispersal
  - Predators
  - Food
  - Environment
  - Disease???


Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across space
and determining the extent of spatial synchrony across populations is an
important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of how
abiotic and biotic factors drive local population dynamics [@Koenig1999a;
@Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the hypothesized drivers
of the population dynamics should approximately match the observed extent of
synchrony across populations. For example, Pacific salmon productivity trends
tend to be synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations
being greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This
provides a first suggestion that regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are
likely drivers of salmon productivity.

Four processes have been hypothesized to drive spatial synchrony in animal
populations including dispersal, disease, predation, and environmental
stochasticity [@Koenig1999a; @Bjornstad1999a].  For Pacific salmon, dispersal
occurs when adults from one population stray from their natal spawning area and
reproduce with another population. Although salmon dispersal plays an important
role in meta-population dynamics, dispersal rates are likely too low to
synchronize populations across 100's of kilometers [@Schtickzelle2007;
@Brenner2012; @Rogers2008]. In some areas, predation and host/parasite dynamics
may be contributing factors to spatial synchrony across salmon populations. For
example, along the southern British Columbia coast, infection of wild salmon
with sea lice from Atlantic salmon farms has been shown to reduce population
growth for wild pink and coho salmon population that migrate past the salmon
farms [@Connors2010; @Krkosek2011]. Similarly, mobile predators such as birds,
and marine mammals predate salmon across numerous populations, although it is
unclear if predation rates from these predators are high enough to cause
synchrony across population [@Ford2016; @Springer2014].  However, in many areas
(e.g., Alaska) the prevalence of disease and spatial extent of predation within
and across populations is largely unknown due to the lack of pertinent data,
making it difficult to estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms in
driving the observed spatial synchrony.

Synchronous environmental conditions have long been cited as a likely mechanism
driving spatial synchrony in animal populations. Although the Moran effect was
originally formulated using abiotic factors (e.g., temperature), it is now often
broadened to also include biotic factors such as food resource availability.
For Pacific salmon, mortality during the ocean life phase is widely recognized
to be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a; @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a],
with a large fraction of the mortality (e.g., > 70%) occurring during the first
year of ocean residency [@Parker1968a; @Peterman1985a; @Beamish2001a;
@Wertheimer2007a].  During this critical period, food resources, and in
particular zooplankton abundances, have been shown to be important factors in
determining salmon growth rates, as well as productivity, indicating that
processes regulating food resource availability likely have a strong impact on
individual stock productivities, and may be a key driver of spatial synchrony in
productivity across stocks [@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

# Multiple working hypotheses

Over the past 100 years, three primary hypotheses have been put forward to
explain variability in fish stock abundances including year-class success,
fishing and recruitment, and adult trophic interactions. The first
hypothesis, year-class success, focuses on the processes affecting the
pre-recruit life stages, such as prey availability, predation, dispersal,
physiology, and growth. The second hypothesis, fishing and recruitment,
largely focuses on the effects of fishing mortality and the size of the
spawning stock on recruitment of individuals into the fishery. The third
hypothesis, adult trophic interactions, focuses on the ecosystem level and
how prey and predation of adults influences abundances.

Hypotheses to explain variability in abundances and distribution of
exploited fish species:
  1. year-class success
     - parental condition
     - prey availability
     - dispersal
     - predation
     - growth
  2. fishing and recruitment
     - spawning stock size
     - fishing intensity/exploitation rate
  3. adult trophic interactions
     - predation of adults
     - adult prey availability
  4. migration/movement
     - variable movement/migration affects availability to fishery/surveys


The first of these hypotheses is largely the purview of fisheries oceanography
and focuses on the processes affecting the pre-recruit life stages. The second
hypothesis, fishing and recruitment, is largely the purview of fisheries science
and

[^2] there is also a fourth hypothesis, migration/movement, however this
hypothesis mainly deals with the availability of fish to a fishery and
assumes that abundance is relatively constant.

- multiple factors/hypotheses
- cumulative effects
- strength of evidence
- sequential (in series) vs. parallel factors/hypotheses

Simultaneously investigating multiple competing hypotheses is a hallmark of the
Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses first outlined in 1890 by
T.C. Chamberlin. In this seminal paper, Chamberlin warned that "We are so prone
to attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an agency
present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to recognize that
it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in the accomplishment of the
total result." To overcome the trap of the 'ruling hypothesis' he suggests

The idea of simultaneously investigating multiple competing hypotheses was
first introduced by the 19th century geologist T.C. Chamberlin. Chamberlin
outlined the method of multiple working hypotheses, which he defined as

In fisheries science, identifying causative factors of observed phenomena,
such as changes in stock productivity, is exceedingly difficult because
there is often evidence for more than one hypothesis.

A key assumption of this previous work on the links between vertical transport
and productivity of higher-trophic-level species is that there is a strong
relationship between phytoplankton dynamics and salmon productivity, however,
this assumption is largely untested. In the Northeast Pacific, phytoplankton
dynamics are primarily characterized by the spring phytoplankton bloom, which
has two primary modes of variability, the timing of the bloom and the intensity
of the bloom [CITE]. In chapter xxx, I explore the relationships between spring
bloom dynamics and salmon productivity by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity. I find strong evidence for effects of the timing of the spring
bloom as well as phytoplankton biomass following the bloom on salmon
productivity throughout the North Pacific Rim.

- There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food resources

For instance, @Nickelson1986a and @Logerwell2003a showed positive relationships
between average upwelling intensity and marine survival of coho salmon in the
Northern California Current, whereas @Pearcy1997 and @Botsford2002 provided
evidence that this relationship may be non-stationary through time.  juvenile

In chapter 1, I explore this assumption by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity. If phytoplankton dynamics are an important driver of salmon
productivity we should expect the spatial scale of variability in phytoplankton
dynamics to match those of salmon productivity. I test this expectation using a
series of non-parametric covariance models to estimate the distance of spatial
covariation for the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, chl-a biomass, and
pink salmon productivity. I find strong evidence for a match in spatial
covariation between the phytoplankton dynamics and pink salmon productivity,
which provides a first indication.

The results of this research have been mixed with some studies indicating
positive relationships between productivity and upwelling intensity and others
indicated no relationship.

- Horizontal transport (ch. 2)
  - There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food
    resources available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes in
    horizontal transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton
    to be advected into or out of coastal areas.

  - Since zooplankton, along with many other items consumed by juvenile salmon,
    are passive drifters, it suggests that ocean currents may play a role in
    determining foraging conditions of juvenile salmon during the early marine
    life phase. Ocean currents also represent an important intermediate link
    between atmospheric conditions and biological productivity (Brodeur and Ware
    1992; Keister et al. 2011).

  - Because the proliferation of this horizontal ocean transport hypothesis is
    fairly new, it has not be tested beyond a few local scale studies. In
    chapter 2, I explore explore the effects of the dominate

- Multiple mechanisms (ch. 3)
  - The two previously discussed hypotheses for how bottom-up forcing may drive

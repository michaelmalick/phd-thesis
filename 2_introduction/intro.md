# General Introduction

Abundances of exploited marine and anadromous fish populations vary over time
and space by orders of magnitude, with 10-fold changes not being unusual.
Despite a century of research, much uncertainty remains in our understanding of
the processes underlying this variability, leading to increased risk for
management agencies, fish stocks, and users of the resource.  The drivers of
fluctuations in abundance have been widely debated in fisheries science and at
the core of this debate is contention over the relative importance of
environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in controlling the
dynamics of exploited fish populations. In many cases, separating the effects of
fishing and the environmental may not be possible without extreme management
actions and this has resulted in environmental effects being largely abscent in
fisheries assessments [@Walters2004b, pg. 176-177].  However, in the face of
unprecedented environmental change, continuing to ignore environment effects on
exploited populations may be costly from an economic, management, and ecological
perspective.

For Pacific salmon, as well as several pelagic and demersal marine fish species,
three lines of evidence suggest that environmental stochasticity is indeed a
leading driver of variability in stock productivity. First, paleo-ecological
studies have shown that fish populations experienced large fluctuations in
abundance prior to the onset of commercial fishing
[@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent effects
often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
[@Peterman1987a; @Szuwalski2015a; @Cury2014]. Finally, shifts in the underlying
mean productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental regime shifts
[@Anderson1999a; @Chavez2003a; @Rothschild2000a].

Although these three lines of evidence provide a first suggestion of the
importance of environmental stochasticity, detecting the effects of
environmental stochasticity on fish populations is difficult because fish
population abundances are affected by multiple ecological factors including
dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent effects),
predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and resource
availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental stochasticity on
these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in
environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many drivers. For
example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the
distribution of predator populations and the the availability of food
resources. Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on
fish populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds,
and reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change
affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of
competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.

[^1] Throughout this thesis, the term productivity refers to the per capita
growth rate for a population, which for Pacific salmon is estimated as the
number of recruits produced per spawner.


## Bottom-up forcing hypotheses

Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective [@Parker1971a; @Holtby1990a; @McGurk1996a; @Moss2005a]
Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced mortality rates
compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of marine mortality of
salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the first year of ocean
residency, indicating that growth rates during this period are particularly
important for determining stock productivity
[@Parker1968a; @Peterman1985a; @Beamish2001a; @Wertheimer2007a] During this
critical period, foraging conditions, and in particular zooplankton abundances,
have been shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth rates, as
well as productivity, indicating that bottom-up forcing mechanisms likely have a
strong impact on Pacific salmon year class strength
[@Perry1996a; @Armstrong2005a].

A prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis in marine ecosystems posits that
vertical transport processes modulates surface primary production. In
particular, processes controlling water column stratification and the movement
of deep nutrient rich water to the surface are frequently cited as key elements
driving phytoplankton dynamics. For example, in coastal upwelling areas, winds
drive surface waters offshore through Ekman dynamics, causing deep nutrient rich
water to upwell into the photic zone, providing the necessary nutrients for
primary production. In turn, this primary production provides grazing
opportunities for zooplankton, and thus provides a pathway between vertical
ocean transport and salmon productivity.

For Pacific salmon, testing this vertical transport hypothesis has mainly
focused on the relationships between average upwelling intensity and
productivity of individual salmon stocks with mixed results.  A key assumption
of this previous work on the links between vertical transport and productivity
of higher-trophic-level species is that there is a strong relationship between
phytoplankton dynamics and salmon productivity, however, this assumption is
largely untested.  In chapter 1, I explore this vertical transport hypothesis by
asking whether the phenology or intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can
explain variability in salmon productivity. In particular, I use hierarchical
models to estimate the effects of spring bloom initiation date and phytoplankton
biomass on productivity of 27 pink salmon populations. I find strong evidence
for effects of the spring bloom on pink salmon productivity with the phenology
of bloom consistently being a better predictor of salmon productivity than
phytoplankton biomass.

Recently, an alternative bottom-up forcing hypothesis has emerged that suggests
that horizontal ocean transport may be as equally important as vertical
transport in determining productivity of higher-trophic-level species. The
horizontal transport hypothesis suggests that food resources available to
juvenile salmon is driven by changes in horizontal transport processes,
e.g., ocean currents or eddies, that cause zooplankton or other weakly/passive
drifters to be advected into or out of coastal areas. For example, in the
California Current, research has indicated that the composition of copepods in
coastal areas is largely determined by advection processes.

For Pacific salmon, the effects of horizontal transport on productivity has
largely not been tested, except for a few local scale studies.  In chapter 2, I
develop a method for indexing variability in the NPC and estimate relationships
between variability in the positioning and intensity of the NPC on 163 North
American pink, chum, and sockeye salmon stocks. I find that stocks of these
species in the southern part of their North American range (i.e., throughout
British Columbia and Washington) are most strongly affected by variability in
horizontal ocean transport and the effect attenuates for stocks that enter the
ocean at higher latitudes.


## Ecological pathways

In chapters 1 and 2, I find evidence for two competing bottom-up forcing
hypotheses; the vertical transport hypothesis and the horizontal transport
hypothesis. However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may have
additive or multiplicative effects on salmon productivity. Because both the
vertical and horizontal transport hypotheses focus on ocean processes that occur
at the regional spatial scale, both hypotheses may be affected by larger scale
processes, such as climate processes. Indeed, hierarchy theory suggests that
large-scale processes likely 'set the stage' for smaller scale processes by
defining boundaries that constrain the smaller-scale processes [@Allen1982a].

It is widely recognized that the dynamics of the North Pacific are partially
controlled by inter-decadal fluctuations in large-scale climate and ocean
processes [@Mantua1997a; @Hare1999a].  The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and
the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) represent two of the major modes of
large-scale variability in the North Pacific [@Mantua2002a; @Di-Lorenzo2008a].
Fluctuations in these patterns, often referred to as regime shifts, can
substantially alter the physical and biological processes in the North Pacific
[@Chavez2003a]. A major reversal of the PDO in 1976/77 is one of the best
documented cases of the impacts of regime shifts on the dynamics of the North
Pacific [@Mantua1997a; @Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a; @Hunt2002a].  Following
this regime shift, the species composition of the North Pacific shifted from a
crustacean-dominated system to a gadid and flatfish-dominated system
[@Anderson1999a; @Mueter2000a].  Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye
salmon (O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased
by more than 65% after the regime shift [@Ruggerone2010a].

While, changes in large-spatial-scale climate patterns, such as the PDO, are
often correlated with indices of salmon productivity, there are many
intermediate-scale linkages between climate patterns and salmon productivity, as
well as multiple pathways that can connect climate and salmon
[@Mueter2002a; @Beamish2004b; @Drinkwater2010a]. For example, the vertical
transport hypothesis represents one pathway in which large-scale climate
processes may impact higher-trophic-level dynamics and the horizontal transport
hypothesis represents an alternative pathway. In chapter 3, I estimate the
cumulative effects of these pathways on productivity of coho salmon in the
Northern California Current using Bayesian network. Results of this analysis
strongly indicated that both the vertical and horizontal transport pathways
simultaneously affect salmon productivity and indicate the need to account for
the cumulative effects of competing hypothesis of how environmental
stochasticity affects higher-trophic-level species.

## Contributions

I am the sole author of chapters xxx and xxx (general introduction and
discussion, respectively) and these chapters are written in the first-person
singular. Chapters xxx-xxx are derived from either published manuscripts or
submitted manuscripts with co-authors and these chapters are written in the
first-person plural. For each of the chapters deriving from multi-authored
manuscripts (chapters xxx-xxx), I am the first-author of the work and performed
the data analysis and wrote the first draft of the text. These chapters,
however, benefited greatly from discussions, editing, and comments from the
co-author. The original published sources of these chapters are provided at the
beginning of each chapter. The initial ideas for chapter (bloom) were developed
by myself, Randall Peterman, Franz Mueter and Sean Cox. Chapter (npc) builds on
ideas originally presented in an unpublished manuscript by Randall Peterman,
Franz Mueter, and Brigitte Dorner. The idea for chapter (bn) came out of
discussions between myself and Randall Peterman following a presentation on
Bayesian networks by Catherine Michielsens. The ideas presented in chapter
(policy) were initially developed by myself, Murray Rutherford, and Sean Cox.

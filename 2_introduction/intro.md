# General Introduction

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations is understanding how environmental stochasticity affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Although it is widely recognized
that variability in the structure and function of marine ecosystems, is in part,
driven by environmental stochasticity, the effects of environmental conditions
on higher-trophic-level species has been and continues to be debated in
fisheries science. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations. In many cases,
separating the effects of fishing and environmental stochasticity on exploited
populations may not be possible without extreme management actions. However,
ignoring the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish stock productivity
may be costly from an economic, management and ecological perspective. For
example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an
unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the
effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the
collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery. Thus, avoiding similar undesirable
management outcomes in the future will likely require anticipating how
environmental change will impact marine and anadromous fish populations.

At least three lines of evidence further suggest that environmental
stochasticity is indeed a leading driver of variability in fish stock
productivity. First, paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations
experienced large fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial
fishing [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent
effects often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
[@Peterman1987a]. Finally, shifts in the underlying mean productivity of stocks
often coincide with environmental regime shifts. Combined, these lines of
evidence indicate the need...

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability. The effects of environmental stochasticity on these
drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental
conditions can have widespread effects across many drivers. For example, changes
in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the distribution of predator
populations and the the availability of food resources. Furthermore,
environmental conditions may also have direct effects on fish populations, for
example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and reproduction.
Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects fish populations
requires understanding the relative importance of competing hypotheses of how
fish populations respond to environmental change.

## Spatial variability

Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across space
and determining the extent of spatial synchrony across populations is an
important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of how
abiotic and biotic factors drive local population dynamics
[@Koenig1999a; @Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the
hypothesized drivers of the population dynamics should match the observed extent
of synchrony across populations. For example, it has been hypothesized that
large-scale climate processes, such as the PDO, are a dominant driver of Pacific
salmon productivity. According to this hypothesis, an expectations would be that
productivity of individual salmon stocks is synchronous over large spatial
scales (i.e., > 1000 km). However, Pacific salmon productivity trends tend to be
synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations being
greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This
provides a first suggestion that regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are
likely drivers of salmon productivity.

Four processes have been hypothesized to drive spatial synchrony in animal
populations including dispersal, disease, predation, and environmental
stochasticity.  For Pacific salmon, dispersal occurs when adults from one
population stray from their natal spawning area and reproduce with another
population. Although salmon dispersal plays an important role in meta-population
dynamics, dispersal rates are likely too low to synchronize populations across
100's of kilometers [@Schtickzelle2007; @Brenner2012; @Rogers2008]. In some
areas, predation and host/parasite dynamics may be contributing factors to
spatial synchrony across salmon populations. For example, along the southern
British Columbia coast, infection of wild salmon with sea lice from Atlantic
salmon farms has been shown to reduce population growth for wild pink and coho
salmon population that migrate past the salmon farms [CITE]. Similarly, mobile
predators such as birds, and marine mammals predate salmon across numerous
populations, although it is unclear if predation rates from these predators are
high enough to cause synchrony across population [CITE]. However, in many
areas (e.g., Alaska) the prevalence of disease and spatial extent of predation
within and across populations is largely unknown, making it difficult to
estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms in driving the observed
spatial synchrony.

Among the four hypothesized mechanisms driving spatial synchrony across animal
populations, synchronous environmental conditions is the most studied.

## Ecological pathways

Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective (Parker 1971; Holtby et al. 1990; McGurk 1996; Moss et
al. 2005). Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced
mortality rates compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of
marine mortality of salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the
first years of ocean residency, indicating that growth rates during this period
are particularly important for determining stock productivity (Parker 1968;
Peterman 1985; Beamish and Mahnken 2001; Wertheimer and Thrower 2007).  During
this critical period, foraging conditions, and in particular zooplankton
abundances, have been shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth
rates, as well as productivity (Perry et al. 1996; Armstrong et al. 2005). Thus,
bottom-up forcing mechanisms likely have a strong impact on Pacific salmon year
class strength.


A prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis in marine ecosystems posits that
vertical ocean transport processes modulates surface primary production. For
example, in coastal upwelling areas winds drive surface waters offshore through
Ekman transport, bringing deep nutrient rich water into the photic zone,
providing the necessary nutrients for the spring phytoplankton bloom, which in
turn affects secondary production, for instance, of zooplankton, which are a key
food resource for juvenile salmon in coastal habitats. For Pacific salmon,
testing this vertical transport hypothesis has mainly focused on the
relationships between average upwelling intensity and productivity of individual
salmon stocks with mixed results. For instance, @Nickelson1986a and
@Logerwell2003a showed positive relationships between average upwelling
intensity and marine survival of coho salmon in the Northern California Current,
whereas @Pearcy1997 and @Botsford2002 provided evidence that this relationship
may be non-stationary through time.

A key assumption of this previous work on the links between vertical transport
and productivity of higher-trophic-level species is that there is a strong
relationship between primary production and salmon productivity.
In chapter 1, I explore this assumption by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity.


The
results of this research have been mixed with some studies indicating positive
relationships between productivity and upwelling intensity and others indicated
no relationship.


- Ideally, to estimate the effects of bottom-up control on salmon productivity,
  we would want to look at relationships between productivity and food resources
  directly, however, the spatial extent of food supply data is limited.

- To get around this, previous research has relied on physical oceanographic
  data, for example, by estimating relationships between upwelling intensity and
  salmon productivity

- But, with the advent of remote sensing satellites, we are now able to
  investigate relationships between phytoplankton and salmon productivity, which
  gets us one step closer.

- There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food resources
  available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes in horizontal
  transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton to be adverted
  into or out of coastal areas

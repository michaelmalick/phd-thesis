# General Introduction

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations is understanding how environmental stochasticity affects
demographic rates of exploited populations. Although it is widely recognized
that variability in the structure and function of marine ecosystems, is in part,
driven by environmental stochasticity, the effects of environmental conditions
on higher-trophic-level species has been and continues to be debated in
fisheries science. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations. In many cases,
separating the effects of fishing and environmental stochasticity on exploited
populations may not be possible without extreme management actions. However,
ignoring the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish stock productivity
may be costly from an economic, management and ecological perspective. For
example, ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an
unprecedented rate over the past two decades and a failure to account for the
effects of this warming on cod stock productivity likely contributed to the
collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery. Thus, avoiding similar undesirable
management outcomes in the future will likely require anticipating how
environmental change will impact marine and anadromous fish populations.

At least three lines of evidence further suggest that environmental
stochasticity is indeed a leading driver of variability in fish stock
productivity. First, paleo-ecological studies have shown that fish populations
experienced large fluctuations in abundance prior to the onset of commercial
fishing [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock density-dependent
effects often explain little of the observed variability in stock productivity
[@Peterman1987a]. Finally, shifts in the underlying mean productivity of stocks
often coincide with environmental regime shifts. Combined, these lines of
evidence indicate the need...

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability. The effects of environmental stochasticity on these
drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental
conditions can have widespread effects across many drivers. For example, changes
in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the distribution of predator
populations and the the availability of food resources. Furthermore,
environmental conditions may also have direct effects on fish populations, for
example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and reproduction.
Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects fish populations
requires understanding the relative importance of competing hypotheses of how
fish populations respond to environmental change.

## Spatial variability

Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across space
and determining the extent of spatial synchrony across populations is an
important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of how
abiotic and biotic factors drive local population dynamics
[@Koenig1999a; @Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the
hypothesized drivers of the population dynamics should match the observed extent
of synchrony across populations. For example, it has been hypothesized that
large-scale climate processes, such as the PDO, are a dominant driver of Pacific
salmon productivity. According to this hypothesis, an expectations would be that
productivity of individual salmon stocks is synchronous over large spatial
scales (i.e., > 1000 km). However, Pacific salmon productivity trends tend to be
synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations being
greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This
provides a first suggestion that regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are
likely drivers of salmon productivity.

Four processes have been hypothesized to drive spatial synchrony in animal
populations including dispersal, disease, predation, and environmental
stochasticity.  For Pacific salmon, dispersal occurs when adults from one
population stray from their natal spawning area and reproduce with another
population. Although salmon dispersal plays an important role in meta-population
dynamics, dispersal rates are likely too low to synchronize populations across
100's of kilometers [@Schtickzelle2007; @Brenner2012; @Rogers2008]. In some
areas, predation and host/parasite dynamics may be contributing factors to
spatial synchrony across salmon populations. For example, along the southern
British Columbia coast, infection of wild salmon with sea lice from Atlantic
salmon farms has been shown to reduce population growth for wild pink and coho
salmon population that migrate past the salmon farms [CITE]. Similarly, mobile
predators such as birds, and marine mammals predate salmon across numerous
populations, although it is unclear if predation rates from these predators are
high enough to cause synchrony across population [CITE]. However, in many areas
(e.g., Alaska) the prevalence of disease and spatial extent of predation within
and across populations is largely unknown due to the lack of pertinent data,
making it difficult to estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms in
driving the observed spatial synchrony.

Among the four hypothesized mechanisms driving spatial synchrony across animal
populations, synchronous environmental conditions is the most studied.

## Ecological pathways

Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective (Parker 1971; Holtby et al. 1990; McGurk 1996; Moss et
al. 2005). Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced
mortality rates compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of
marine mortality of salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the
first years of ocean residency, indicating that growth rates during this period
are particularly important for determining stock productivity (Parker 1968;
Peterman 1985; Beamish and Mahnken 2001; Wertheimer and Thrower 2007).  During
this critical period, foraging conditions, and in particular zooplankton
abundances, have been shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth
rates, as well as productivity indicating that bottom-up forcing mechanisms
likely have a strong impact on Pacific salmon year class strength (Perry et
al. 1996; Armstrong et al. 2005).

A prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis in marine ecosystems posits that
vertical transport processes modulates surface primary production. For example,
in coastal upwelling areas, winds drive surface waters offshore through Ekman
transport, causing deep nutrient rich water to 'upwell' into the photic zone,
providing the necessary nutrients for primary production in general and the
spring phytoplankton bloom in particular. Primary production occurring during
the spring phytoplankton bloom in turn affects secondary production, for
instance, of zooplankton, which are a key food resource for juvenile salmon in
coastal habitats. For Pacific salmon, testing this vertical transport hypothesis
has mainly focused on the relationships between average upwelling intensity and
productivity of individual salmon stocks with mixed results.

A key assumption of this previous work on the links between vertical transport
and productivity of higher-trophic-level species is that there is a strong
relationship between phytoplankton dynamics and salmon productivity, however,
this assumption is largely untested. In the Northeast Pacific, phytoplankton
dynamics are primarily characterized by the spring phytoplankton bloom, which
has two primary modes of variability, the timing of the bloom and the intensity
of the bloom [CITE]. In chapter xxx, I explore the relationships between spring
bloom dynamics and salmon productivity by asking whether the phenology or
intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom can explain variability in salmon
productivity. I find strong evidence for effects of the timing of the spring
bloom as well as phytoplankton biomass following the bloom on salmon
productivity throughout the North Pacific Rim.

Recently, an alternative bottom-up forcing hypothesis has emerged that suggests
that food resources available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes
in horizontal transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton to
be advected into or out of coastal areas.  In chapter xxx, I develop a method
for indexing variability in the NPC and estimate relationships between
variability in the positioning and intensity of the NPC on 16x North American
pink, chum, and sockeye salmon stocks. I find that stocks of these species in
the southern part of their North American range (i.e., throughout British
Columbia and Washington) are most strongly affected by variability in horizontal
ocean transport.

In chapters xxx and xxx, I find evidence for two competing bottom-up forcing
hypotheses. However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may have
additive or multiplicative effects on salmon productivity. Because both the
vertical and horizontal transport hypotheses focus on ocean processes that occur
at the regional spatial scale, both hypotheses may be driving by larger scale
processes, such as climate processes. Indeed, hierarchy theory suggests that
large-scale processes likely 'set the stage' for smaller scale processes by
defining boundaries that constrain the smaller-scale processes.

It is widely recognized that the dynamics of the North Pacific are partially
controlled by inter-decadal fluctuations in large-scale climate and ocean
processes (Mantua et al. 1997; Hare et al. 1999). The Pacific Decadal
Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) represent two of
the major modes of large-scale variability in the North Pacific (Mantua and Hare
2002; Di Lorenzo et al.  2008). Fluctuations in these patterns, often referred
to as regime shifts, can substantially alter the physical and biological
processes in the North Pacific (Chavez et al. 2003). A major reversal of the PDO
in 1976/77 is one of the best documented cases of the impacts of regime shifts
on the dynamics of the North Pacific (Mantua et al. 1997; Anderson and Piatt
1999; Mueter and Norcross 2000; Hunt et al. 2002). Following this regime shift,
the species composition of the North Pacific shifted from a crustacean-dominated
system to a gadid and flatfish-dominated system (Anderson and Piatt 1999; Mueter
and Norcross 2000). Moreover, the abundances of wild adult sockeye salmon
(O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the North Pacific increased by more
than 65% after the regime shift (Ruggerone et al. 2010).

While, changes in large-spatial-scale climate patterns, such as the PDO, are
often correlated with indices of salmon productivity, there are many
intermediate-scale linkages between climate patterns and salmon productivity, as
well as multiple pathways that can connect climate and salmon (Mueter et
al. 2002a; Beamish et al. 2004; Drinkwater et al. 2010). For example, the
vertical transport hypothesis represents one pathway in which large-scale
climate processes may impact higher-trophic-level dynamics and the horizontal
transport hypothesis represents an alternative pathway. In chapter xxx, I
estimate the cumulative effects of these pathways on productivity of coho salmon
in the Northern California Current using Bayesian network. Results of this
analysis strongly indicated that both the vertical and horizontal transport
pathways simultaneously affect salmon productivity and indicate the need to
account for the cumulative effects of competing hypothesis of how environmental
stochasticity affects higher-trophic-level species.

## Contributions

I am the sole author of chapters xxx and xxx (general introduction and
discussion, respectively) and these chapters are written in the first-person
singular. Chapters xxx-xxx are derived from either published manuscripts or
submitted manuscripts with co-authors and these chapters are written in the
first-person plural. For each of the chapters deriving from multi-authored
manuscripts (chapters xxx-xxx), I am the first-author of the work and performed
the data analysis and wrote the first draft of the text. These chapters,
however, benefited greatly from discussions, editing, and comments from the
co-author. The original published sources of these chapters are provided at the
beginning of each chapter. The initial ideas for chapter (bloom) were developed
by myself, Randall Peterman, Franz Mueter and Sean Cox. Chapter (npc) builds on
ideas originally presented in an unpublished manuscript by Randall Peterman,
Franz Mueter, and Brigitte Dorner. The idea for chapter (bn) came out of
discussions between myself and Randall Peterman following a presentation on
Bayesian networks by Catherine Michielsens. The ideas presented in chapter
(policy) were initially developed by myself, Murray Rutherford, and Sean Cox.

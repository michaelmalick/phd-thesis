# General Introduction

A critical challenge to maintaining viable and productive marine and anadromous
fish populations is understanding how environmental change affects demographic
rates of exploited populations. Indeed, responses of marine and anadromous fish
populations to changes in environmental conditions have been widely observed and
may impact fisheries management outcomes. For example, ocean temperatures in
the Gulf of Maine have been increasing at an unprecedented rate over the past
two decades and a failure to account for the effects of this warming on cod
stock productivity likely contributed to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod
fishery. Therefore, understanding the drivers of the variability in productivity
is critical for anticipating how perturbations to the marine ecosystem will
impact salmon populations.

For marine and anadromous fish populations, there are at least three lines of
evidence that suggest environmental conditions are a leading driver of
variability in productivity. First, paleo-ecological studies have shown that
salmon populations experienced large fluctuations in abundance prior to the
onset of commercial fishing [@Finney2000; @Rogers2013a]. Second, within-stock
density-dependent effects often explain little of the observed variability in
stock productivity [@Peterman1987a]. Third, shifts in the underlying mean
productivity of stocks often coincide with environmental regime shifts.

Detecting the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because fish population abundances are affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability. The effects of environmental stochasticity on these
drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead, changes in environmental
conditions can have widespread effects across many drivers. For example, changes
in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the distribution of predator
populations and the the availability of food resources. Furthermore,
environmental conditions may also have direct effects on fish populations, for
example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and reproduction.
Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects fish populations
requires understanding the relative importance of competing hypotheses of how
fish populations respond to environmental change.

## Spatial variability

Demographic rates of fish populations often fluctuate synchronously across space
and determining the extent of spatial synchrony across populations is an
important first step in differentiating between alternative hypotheses of how
abiotic and biotic factors drive local population dynamics
[@Koenig1999a; @Bjornstad1999a]. In particular, the spatial scale of the
hypothesized drivers of the population dynamics should match the observed extent
of synchrony across populations. For example, it has been hypothesized that
large-scale climate processes, such as the PDO, are a dominant driver of Pacific
salmon productivity. According to this hypothesis, an expectations would be that
productivity of individual salmon stocks is synchronous over large spatial
scales (i.e., > 1000 km). However, Pacific salmon productivity trends tend to be
synchronous at the regional-scale with synchrony among populations being
greatest at distances less than 500 km [@Mueter2002b; @Pyper2005a]. This
provides a first suggestion that regional-scale abiotic or biotic factors are
likely drivers of salmon productivity.

Four processes have been hypothesized to drive spatial synchrony in animal
populations including dispersal, disease, predation, and environmental
stochasticity.  For Pacific salmon, dispersal occurs when adults from one
population stray from their natal spawning area and reproduce with another
population. Although salmon dispersal plays an important role in meta-population
dynamics, dispersal rates are likely too low to synchronize populations across
100's of kilometers [@Schtickzelle2007; @Brenner2012; @Rogers2008]. In some
areas, predation and host/parasite dynamics may be contributing factors to
spatial synchrony across salmon populations. For example, along the southern
British Columbia coast, infection of wild salmon with sea lice from Atlantic
salmon farms has been shown to reduce population growth for wild pink and coho
salmon population that migrate past the salmon farms [CITE]. Similarly, mobile
predators such as birds, and marine mammals predate salmon across numerous
populations, although it is unclear if predation rates from these predators are
high enough to cause synchrony across population [CITE]. However, in many
areas (e.g., Alaska) the prevalence of disease and spatial extent of predation
within and across populations is largely unknown, making it difficult to
estimate the relative importance of these mechanisms in driving the observed
spatial synchrony.

Among the four hypothesized mechanisms driving spatial synchrony across animal
populations, synchronous environmental conditions is the most studied.

## Ecological pathways

Mortality of Pacific salmon during the ocean life phase is widely recognized to
be size selective (Parker 1971; Holtby et al. 1990; McGurk 1996; Moss et
al. 2005). Consequently, faster growing salmon are expected to have reduced
mortality rates compared to slower growing conspecifics. A large fraction of
marine mortality of salmon (e.g., > 70%) is also thought to occur during the
first years of ocean residency, indicating that growth rates during this period
are particularly important for determining stock productivity (Parker 1968;
Peterman 1985; Beamish and Mahnken 2001; Wertheimer and Thrower 2007).  During
this critical period, foraging conditions, and in particular zooplankton
abundances, have been shown to be important factors in determining salmon growth
rates, as well as productivity (Perry et al. 1996; Armstrong et al. 2005). Thus,
bottom-up forcing mechanisms likely have a strong impact on Pacific salmon year
class strength.

- A leading hypothesis of how bottom-up forcing can influence
  higher-trophic-level species such as salmon starts with physical oceanographic
  conditions, and in particular vertical transport of nutrients into the upper
  water column

- For example, in coastal upwelling areas winds drive surface water offshore
  through Ekman transport, which brings cool nutrient rich water into the photic
  zone, which fuels the spring phytoplankton bloom and in turn secondary
  production, for example, of zooplankton, which are a key food resource for
  juvenile salmon in coastal habitats

- Ideally, to estimate the effects of bottom-up control on salmon productivity,
  we would want to look at relationships between productivity and food resources
  directly, however, the spatial extent of food supply data is limited.

- To get around this, previous research has relied on physical oceanographic
  data, for example, by estimating relationships between upwelling intensity and
  salmon productivity

- But, with the advent of remote sensing satellites, we are now able to
  investigate relationships between phytoplankton and salmon productivity, which
  gets us one step closer.

- There is an alternative hypothesis as well, that suggests that food resources
  available to juvenile salmon may also be driven by changes in horizontal
  transport, i.e., ocean current patterns, that cause zooplankton to be adverted
  into or out of coastal areas

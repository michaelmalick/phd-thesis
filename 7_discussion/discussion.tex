\section{Main conclusions from
chapters}\label{main-conclusions-from-chapters}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  ``Our results suggest that changes in spring bloom timing resulting
  from natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change could
  potentially cause latitudinal shifts in salmon productivity.''
\item
  ``Our results indicated that horizontal transport pathways may
  strongly influence population dynamics of Pacific salmon in the
  southern part of their North American ranges, but not the northern
  part, suggesting that different environmental pathways may underlie
  changes in salmon productivity in northern and southern areas for the
  species under consideration.''
\item
  ``Our results provide evidence that shifts in climate patterns could
  strongly influence recruitment simultaneously through multiple
  ecological pathways and highlight the importance of quantifying
  cumulative effects of these pathways on higher-trophic-level
  species.''
\item
  ``Our findings further suggest that ecosystem-based management
  policies need to explicitly account for mismatches in the scale at
  which ecosystem services are generated by highly migratory species and
  the scale at which human activities and natural processes impact those
  services.''
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The results presented here strongly suggest that climatic and ocean
  processes can impact salmon populations simultaneously through
  multiple ecological pathways and that the relative importance of these
  pathways is non-stationary through space.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Macro-scale perspective is useful

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Salmon ecology
  \item
    Management and conservation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Uncertainties will always be present

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Need methods to deal with these uncertainties
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Need to account for multiple mechanisms/pathways

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No `smoking gun'
  \item
    Multiple ecological pathways
  \item
    Need to take into account multiple ecological pathways rather than
    searching for a mythical `smoking gun'
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

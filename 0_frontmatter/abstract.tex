Understanding how environmental forcing governs the productivity of marine and
anadromous fish populations is a central, yet elusive, problem in fisheries
science. In this thesis, I use a cross-system comparative approach to
investigate how environmental forcing pathways could link climatic and ocean
processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon (\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin by showing that phytoplankton phenology
and ocean current patterns are both strongly associated with inter-annual
changes in salmon productivity, suggesting that two alternative sets of
environmental pathways may contribute to changes in salmon productivity, where
one set of pathways is mediated by vertical ocean transport and subsequent
phytoplankton dynamics and the other set is mediated by horizontal ocean
transport and subsequent advection of plankton into coastal areas. However, the
relative importance of these pathways may vary over large spatial scales because
the magnitude and direction of the estimated environmental effects on
productivity were conditional on the latitude of juvenile salmon ocean entry. I
then use a novel probabilistic network modeling approach to show that changes in
climatic and ocean processes can impact salmon productivity via multiple
concurrent environmental pathways, including multiple pathways originating from
the same climatic process. Finally, I use policy analysis to demonstrate why
efforts to integrate highly migratory species, such as Pacific salmon, into
ecosystem-based management policies need to explicitly account for mismatches
between the scale of ecosystem services provided by these species and the scale
at which human activities and natural processes impact those services.
Collectively, my thesis provides empirical evidence that accounting for spatial
heterogeneity, joint effects, and relative importance of multiple simultaneously
operating environmental pathways may be critical to developing effective
management strategies that are robust to future environmental change.

% Environmental change resulting from natural or anthropogenic forcing can have
% profound impacts on the structure and function of marine and coastal
% ecosystems. Yet, determining environmental processes governing population
% dynamics of marine and anadromous fish species remains an elusive problem that
% has practical management implications. In this thesis, I use a cross-system
% comparative approach to examine environmental forcing pathways linking
% climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
% (\textit{Oncorhynchus} spp.) populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I
% begin by assessing the evidence for population-level responses to inter-annual
% changes in two meso-scale ocean processes, phytoplankton dynamics and ocean
% currents, which represent critical links within two alternative sets of
% environmental forcing pathways. In the first set of pathways, vertical ocean
% transport and subsequent phytoplankton dynamics are hypothesized to mediate
% the effects of climate variability on higher-trophic-level species, whereas in
% the second set of pathways, climate effects are hypothesized to be mediated by
% horizontal ocean transport and subsequent advection of plankton into coastal
% areas. I show that both phytoplankton dynamics and ocean current patterns are
% strongly associated with changes in salmon productivity, indicating that both
% sets of hypothesized pathways may drive salmon dynamics. However, the
% magnitude and direction of the effects were conditional on the latitude of
% juvenile salmon ocean entry, suggesting that the relative importance of
% different environmental pathways may be region dependent. Next, I use a novel
% quantitative method, probabilistic networks, to examine the joint effect and
% relative strength of 17 potential environmental pathways linking large-scale
% climate processes to Pacific salmon dynamics. I show that multiple
% environmental pathways can simultaneously impact salmon population dynamics,
% including multiple pathways originating from the same climatic process.
% Finally, I use a policy perspective to examine how challenges arising from a
% highly migratory life history can impede efforts to integrate Pacific salmon
% into ecosystem-based management policies. My findings indicate that
% ecosystem-based management policies should explicitly account for mismatches
% in the scale at which ecosystem services are provided by highly migratory
% species and the scale at which human activities and natural processes impact
% those services to achieve more effective integration. Collectively, my thesis
% demonstrates that climatic and ocean processes can impact higher-trophic-level
% species via multiple simultaneously operating environmental pathways and
% accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the relative importance of these
% pathways may be critical to developing effective management strategies that
% are robust to future environmental change. \newline

      \caption[Summary of pink salmon stock-recruit data sets.]{Summary of pink
        salmon stock-recruit data sets. Brood years indicate the temporal range of
        spawning years; N is the number of non-missing years within that range; R
        is the annual average recruitment (catch plus escapement) in millions
        across all brood years; S is the average number of spawners in millions
        across all brood years; $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are maximum likelihood
        estimates of the intercept (i.e., stock productivity at low spawner
        abundances) and slope (i.e., density-dependent effect), respectively, of
        the single-stock Ricker models (eq. \ref{eq:bloom:1}).} \\

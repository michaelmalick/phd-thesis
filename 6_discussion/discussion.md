# General Discussion

## Main conclusions from chapters

1. "Our results suggest that changes in spring bloom timing resulting from
   natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change could potentially
   cause latitudinal shifts in salmon productivity."

2. "Our results indicated that horizontal transport pathways may strongly
   influence population dynamics of Pacific salmon in the southern part of their
   North American ranges, but not the northern part, suggesting that different
   environmental pathways may underlie changes in salmon productivity in
   northern and southern areas for the species under consideration."

3. "Our results provide evidence that shifts in climate patterns could strongly
   influence recruitment simultaneously through multiple ecological pathways and
   highlight the importance of quantifying cumulative effects of these pathways
   on higher-trophic-level species."

4. "Our findings further suggest that ecosystem-based management policies need
   to explicitly account for mismatches in the scale at which ecosystem services
   are generated by highly migratory species and the scale at which human
   activities and natural processes impact those services."

* The results presented here strongly suggest that climatic and ocean processes
  can impact salmon populations simultaneously through multiple ecological
  pathways and that the relative importance of these pathways is non-stationary
  through space.


## Main thesis conclusions

1. Macro-scale perspective is useful
    - Salmon ecology
    - Management and conservation

2. Uncertainties will always be present
    - Need methods to deal with these uncertainties

3. Need to account for multiple mechanisms/pathways
    - No 'smoking gun'
    - Multiple ecological pathways
    - Need to take into account multiple ecological pathways rather than
      searching for a mythical 'smoking gun'

## Other topics

* Climate change impacts on importance of different pathways

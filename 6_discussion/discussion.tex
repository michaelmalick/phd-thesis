\item
  In this thesis, I have sought to contribute to our knowledge of how
  environmental forcing pathways link climatic and ocean processes to
  dynamics of Pacific salmon populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.
  My second and third chapters apply a cross-system comparative approach
  to rigorously assess the evidence for population-level responses to
  inter-annual changes in two meso-scale ocean processes. In chapter 2,
  I examine the hypothesis that phytoplankton dynamics in coastal
  ecosystems---which are largely determined by vertical ocean transport
  processes---are an important driver of Pacific salmon productivity. In
  chapter 3, I examine an alternative hypothesis that suggests that
  ocean processes driven by horizontal ocean transport, such as the
  advection of zooplankton, are equally important drivers of salmon
  productivity as processes driven by vertical ocean transport. My
  fourth chapter builds on the previous chapters, which each focused on
  a single meso-scale ocean process, by exploring the cumulative effects
  and relative importance of multiple environmental pathways on Pacific
  salmon dynamics. My fifth chapter applies an interdisciplinary
  approach to examine challenges to integrating highly-migratory
  anadromous fish species into place-based ecosystem-based management
  policies and provides practical recommendations for overcoming the
  identified challenges. In total, this thesis further develops our
  quantitative understanding about how climatic and ocean processes
  influence the population dynamics of Pacific salmon and in doing so
  contributes to reducing uncertainties about how environmental change
  impacts living marine resources.
\item
  My thesis makes several contributions to the study of environmental
  forcing in coastal ecosystems. My second and third chapters provide
  evidence that environmental forcing pathways mediated by either
  vertical or horizontal ocean transport processes can strongly impact
  the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. In both studies,
  however, the effects of environmental conditions were dependent on the
  geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry, suggesting that in
  some cases environmental forcing is non-stationary across space. A
  practical implication of this spatial non-stationarity is that
  relationships inferred from data in one location may not be applicable
  to another location. My fourth chapter further shows the need to
  account for multiple environmental pathways when considering how
  environmental forcing impacts higher-trophic-level species, e.g., by
  estimating the cumulative effects and relative importance of multiple
  hypothesized pathways linking climatic changes and the dynamics of
  exploited species. My fifth chapter indicates that considering spatial
  scales of the impacts of human and natural disturbances on
  highly-migratory species is an important component to integrating
  these species into ecosystem-based management policies. Together, the
  results presented in this thesis strongly suggest that climatic and
  ocean processes can impact salmon populations simultaneously through
  multiple environmental pathways and that the relative importance of
  these pathways may be non-stationary through space.
\item
  The support for simultaneously operating pathways provided in my
  thesis highlights the need to pursue evidence for multiple competing
  hypotheses to explain observed patterns in the dynamics of marine and
  anadromous fish species. Over a century ago, Chamberlin
  @Chamberlin1965 warned that ``We {[}scientists{]} are so prone to
  attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an agency
  present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to
  recognize that it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in
  the accomplishment of the total result.'' Yet, broadening our focus
  beyond a single hypothesis or set of hypotheses focused around a
  single mechanism remains challenging. For example, the research
  presented in this thesis largely assumes that environmental pathways
  linking climatic and ocean processes to Pacific salmon dynamics occur
  through bottom-up forcing mechanisms. Changes in climatic and physical
  ocean processes, however, can simultaneously impact food resource
  availability and predator distributions (or abundances) and only
  considering environmental forcing pathways that represent bottom-up
  forcing is inherently incomplete. Increasing our ability to detect and
  anticipate the effects of perturbations on marine ecosystems may be
  dependent on evaluating the relative importance of competing
  hypotheses and the cumulative impacts of multiple mechanisms
  hypothesized to drive the observed changes.
\item
  As the climate changes at an unprecedented rate, maintaining viable
  and productive marine and anadromous fish populations will require the
  ability to anticipate how ecological perturbations affect demographic
  rates of exploited species. The contributions to our understanding of
  how climatic and ocean processes relate to demographic rates of
  Pacific salmon presented in this thesis and elsewhere represent a
  first step in increasing this ability. However, many important
  questions remain. For example, what is the relative importance of
  top-down and bottom-up forcing pathways and how will changing
  distributions of marine species impact this relative importance? How
  will changing thermal isotherms and increased ocean acidification
  impact food resource availability for juvenile Pacific salmon? What
  evidence is there for temporal non-stationarity in relationships
  between environmental forcing and productivity of exploited species?
  Over the next few decades, answering these types of questions may be a
  critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.
\item
  Environmental variability is an intrinsic element of coastal
  ecosystems and can have profound impacts on ecosystem structure and
  function as well as the human-derived benefits from the system.
  Uncertainties about the impacts of changing environmental conditions
  on living marine resources are likely to always be present and
  effective decision-making in the presence of this uncertainty is a
  fundamental challenge of managing natural resources. Ultimately,
  understanding how environmental forcing impacts commercially valuable
  species is a necessary component to implementing management actions
  that are robust to a wide range of potential future scenarios.

# Multiple competing hypotheses

   For example, the relative importance of environmental forcing and the
   effects of fishing in controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations
   has been widely debated in fisheries science. In many cases, separating the
   effects of fishing and environmental forcing may not be possible
   without extreme management actions. Yet, climate change is already
   having profound impacts on some marine species and the projected increase in
   extreme events, such as marine heat waves, could have widespread impacts on
   exploited species. Understanding the inter-actions between environmental
   forcing and the effects of fishing ...


   re-organizing the spatial distributions of many species

   including a broader range of competing hypotheses

the effects of environmental conditions on higher-trophic-level fish species has
been, and continues to be, debated in fisheries science [@Walters1988a;
@Skud1975]. At the core of this debate is contention over the relative
importance of environmental stochasticity and the effects of fishing in
controlling the dynamics of exploited fish populations.

   Avoiding such attachments to a single hypothesis may be an important to
   increasing our ability to detect and anticipate the effects of perturbations
   on marine ecosystems.

   In particular, increasing our ability to detect and anticipate the effects of
   perturbations on marine ecosystems will likely require understanding both the
   relative importance of competing hypotheses and the cumulative impacts of
   the mechanisms hypothesized to drive the observed changes.

   For example, attributing a population response to environmental forcing that
   occur through either bottom-up and top-down pathways has been a long standing
   challenge in fisheries oceanography.


   Often times competing
   hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and in these situations efforts should
   be made to understand the cumulative effects


   As my fourth chapter indicates, multiple environmental
   pathways arising from the same climate process can contribute to explaining
   the observed variability in the populations dynamics of Pacific salmon.
   disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways.

   Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels.

   More generally, it may be prudent to place a high priority on identifying
   the potential range of causal mechanisms and seeking evidence for these
   alternative hypotheses, as well as seeking to understand the cumulative
   effects and relative importance of competing hypotheses.

   Only considering a single environmental variable or
   forcing pathway when attempting to understand the drivers of the dynamics of
   exploited species is inherently incomplete.

   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels.


   that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels. For instance, as the climate warms, the relative importance of
   bottom-up and top-down pathways may shift as marine species track preferred
   environmental conditions [@Pinsky2013].

# Challenges remaining

is identifying how relationships between environmental processes and demographic
rates of marine and anadromous fish populations vary over time.

3. This thesis also reveals several remaining challenges in detecting and
   anticipating the effects of environmental forcing on living marine resources.

   A first challenge is disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways. Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels.

   A second challenge is identifying how driver-response relationships vary over
   time. Increasingly, evidence suggests that both environmental processes and
   demographic rates of marine and anadromous fish populations are
   non-stationary through time. Similar to the implications of spatial
   non-stationarity observed in this thesis, temporal non-stationarity in
   driver-response relationships implies that relationships inferred from past
   observation may not hold today and this non-stationarity may partially
   explain why environmental correlations frequently break down over time.
   Time-varying relationships present a particularly difficult challenge for
   projecting how future climate changes may impact living marine resources
   because using historical data to project future outcomes may be misleading.
   Advancements in quantitative methods, such as state-space modeling
   approaches, may provide a useful starting place to find clues on the
   prevalence of time-varying relationships.

   A third challenge is recognizing the need to investigate multiple competing
   hypotheses to explain observed patterns. As my fourth chapter indicates,
   multiple environmental pathways arising from the same climate process can
   contribute to explaining the observed variability in the populations dynamics
   of Pacific salmon. Over a century ago, Chamberlin (1890) warned that "We are
   so prone to attribute a phenomenon to a single cause, that, when we find an
   agency present, we are liable to rest satisfied therewith, and fail to
   recognize that it is but one factor, and perchance a minor factor, in the
   accomplishment of the total result."





   Over the next few decades, addressing these types of challenges may be a
   critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.


   The pursuit of evidence for multiple
   competing hypotheses may be an important component of developing policies
   that

   A third challenge is moving beyond a correlation based understanding
   of ecosystem dynamics to a more causal mechanistic understanding. Despite the
   common refrain that correlation does not imply causation, correlations based
   studies still comprise a large fraction of the research on how environmental
   forcing influences marine and anadromous species. The reliance on correlation
   based studies is partly due to the difficulty in carrying out manipulative
   experiments at scales that are meaningful for management. However, several
   techniques and emerging approaches show promising in helping to improve our
   causal understanding of the system including spatial dynamics of
   driver-response relationships, meta-analytic modeling approaches that can
   synthesize data across multiple spatial scales,

   Over the next few decades, addressing these types of challenges may be a
   critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.


   First, examining the spatial scales of variability in the driver and response
   variables can help determine

   Second, meta-analytic modeling approaches (e.g., hierarchical modeling),

   Third, the increasing availability of high-resolution ocean modeling
   frameworks

Over the next few decades, addressing these types of challenges may be a
critical part of effectively managing our living marine resources.

The utility of improved understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics is largely
dependent on how this understanding can be integrated into applied management.


As management of marine resources increasingly moves towards ecosystem-based
approaches to management, strategic management advice based on empirical
evidence


This will likely occur at a species and system specific basis.



3. This thesis also reveals several remaining challenges in detecting and
   anticipating the effects of environmental forcing on living marine resources.
   A first challenge is disentangling the effects of environmental forcing that
   occur through bottom-up and top-down pathways. Changes in climatic and
   physical ocean processes can simultaneously impact food resource availability
   and predator distributions or abundances. Only considering environmental
   forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing is inherently incomplete
   and future research should strive to further understand interactions and
   cumulative effects of processes driving interactions across multiple trophic
   levels. For instance, as the climate warms, the relative importance of
   bottom-up and top-down pathways may shift as marine species track preferred
   environmental conditions [@Pinsky2013]. End-to-end ecosystem models (e.g.,
   Atlantis) provide one option for improving our understanding of interactions
   between bottom-up and top-down pressures on exploited species, however, in
   many systems data may not be available to parameterize such models.
   Alternatively, models of intermediate complexity, which can allow for
   environmental influence on trophic interactions, may prove useful in
   disentangling the effects of top-down and bottom-up pressures
   [@Plaganyi2014].

4. A second major challenge is moving beyond a correlation based understanding
   of ecosystem dynamics to a more mechanistic understanding. A major limitation
   of relying on correlative relationships to increase our understanding of
   ecosystem dynamics is that these relationships frequently break down over
   time. In this thesis I use two separate techniques to help increase the
   reliability of the correlation based results.

   First, examining the spatial scales of variability in the driver and response
   variables

   Second, meta-analytic modeling approaches (e.g., hierarchical modeling),

   Research on the effects of environmental forcing on marine species often rely
   on variables that represent proxies for other variables that are thought to
   more directly impact the dynamics of the focal species. For example, in
   chapter 4 I use indices of horizontal ocean transport variability

   This use of proxy variables is usually necessitated due to poor data
   availability for processes that are

   With the advent of widespread availability of ocean remote sensing data and
   the increased availability of output from regional ocean modeling systems

Disentangling the effects of environmental stochasticity on fish populations is
difficult because stock productivity is affected by multiple ecological
factors including dynamics internal to the population (e.g., density dependent
effects), predator-prey interactions, intra- and inter-specific competition, and
resource availability [@Ottersen2010a]. The effects of environmental
stochasticity on these drivers of productivity are not isolated, but instead,
changes in environmental conditions can have widespread effects across many
drivers. For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence
the distribution of predator populations and the availability of food
resources. Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on
fish populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds,
and reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change
affects fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of
competing hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.

Only considering environmental forcing pathways that represent bottom-up forcing
is inherently incomplete and future research should strive to further understand
interactions and cumulative effects of processes driving food resource
availability and predator abundances and distributions. The methods outlined in
my fourth chapter (i.e., probabilistic networks), may provide a useful starting
point for estimating cumulative effects and relative importance of bottom-up and
top-down drivers of productivity of marine species.

For example, changes in ocean temperature may simultaneously influence the
distribution of predator populations and the availability of food resources.
Furthermore, environmental conditions may also have direct effects on fish
populations, for example, by influencing metabolic rates, swimming speeds, and
reproduction [CITE]. Therefore, understanding how environmental change affects
fish populations requires understanding the relative importance of competing
hypotheses of how fish populations respond to environmental change.


In this thesis, and the majority of ecological research, environmental driver
and population response relationships are assumed to be constant through time,
i.e., the mean effect is assumed to be stationary. However, evidence suggests
that productivity of marine and anadromous fish species varies over time.
Non-stationarity in driver-response relationships implies that previously
identified relationships may not hold in the future. If these relationships do
vary over time, it suggests that using historical data to project future
outcomes may be misleading.

Despite these advances in understanding how environmental forcing varies across
space, there has less effort in understanding how relationships between
demographic rates of exploited species and environmental conditions change
across time.

The unprecedented rate of environmental change in many marine systems highlights
the importance of increasing our understanding of the pathways that connect
climate and ocean processes to exploited marine species. Yet, integrating
information about environmental forcing into applied management situations


better understanding how ecological driver-response relationships vary over
time. In this thesis, and the majority of ecological research, environmental
driver and population response relationships are assumed to be constant through
time, i.e., the mean effect is assumed to be stationary. However, evidence
suggests that productivity of marine and anadromous fish species varies over
time. Non-stationarity in driver-response relationships implies that previously
identified relationships may not hold in the future. In the presence of
unprecedented rates of change in climate and ocean systems, understanding how
relationships change over space and time will be a critical component to
increasing our ability to detect and anticipate rapid changes in productivity of
commercially valuable species.

# First paragraph (summary)

In this thesis, I have sought to contribute to our knowledge of how
environmental forcing pathways link climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of
Pacific salmon populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In chapter 1, I used
a cross-system comparative approach to examine the hypothesis that phytoplankton
dynamics in coastal ecosystem are an important driver of higher-trophic-level
species productivity. Results from this chapter indicated that the phenology of
the spring phytoplankton bloom (and to a lesser extent phytoplankton biomass) is
strongly associated with salmon productivity, although the direction of the
effect was dependent on the geographic location of juvenile salmon ocean entry.
In chapter 2, I again used a cross-system comparative approach to examine the
alternative hypothesis that horizontal ocean transport is a critical driver of
Pacific salmon productivity. Results from chapter 2 suggested that horizontal
ocean transport can strongly affect salmon productivity for stocks in Washington
and British Columbia, but not for more northern stocks in Alaska. In chapter 3,
I used a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks, to examine the
cumulative effects and relative importance of multiple environmental pathways on
salmon dynamics. Results from this chapter provide evidence that multiple
environmental pathways can simultaneously impact salmon population dynamics,
including multiple pathways that originate from the same climatic process. In
chapter 4, I used a policy perspective to show that mismatches in the scale at
which ecosystem services are provided by Pacific salmon and the scale at which
human activities and natural processes impact those services need to be
explicitly accounted for ecosystem-based management policies.

  My second and third chapters apply a cross-system comparative approach to
  examine the role phytoplankton dynamics and horizontal ocean transport play in
  driving Pacific salmon population dynamics.

  My fourth chapter applies a novel quantitative method, probabilistic networks,
  to examine the cumulative effects and relative importance of multiple
  environmental pathways on salmon dynamics.

  My fifth chapter uses a policy perspective to show that mismatches in the
  scale at which ecosystem services are provided by Pacific salmon and the scale
  at which human activities and natural processes impact those services need to
  be explicitly accounted for ecosystem-based management policies.


In chapters 1 and 2, I used a cross-system comparative approach to examine
specific components of two alternative environmental pathways that have been
hypothesized to link climate processes and Pacific salmon.





# Main thesis conclusion

* The results presented here strongly suggest that climatic and ocean processes
  can impact salmon populations simultaneously through multiple ecological
  pathways and that the relative importance of these pathways is non-stationary
  through space.

* My research suggests that climatic and ocean processes can impact
  higher-trophic-level species via simultaneously operating environmental
  pathways---including pathways mediated by either vertical or horizontal ocean
  transport---and that the relative importance of these pathways can be
  non-stationary through space and time.

2. My thesis makes several contributions to the study of environmental forcing
   in coastal ecosystems. My second and third chapters advance our understanding
   about the relationships between two alternative meso-scale ocean processes
   and productivity of Pacific salmon populations. Results from these two
   chapters provide evidence that environmental forcing pathways mediated by
   either vertical or horizontal ocean transport processes can strongly impact
   the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. My fourth chapter further
   suggests the need to account for multiple environmental pathways when
   considering how environmental forcing impacts higher-trophic-level species,
   e.g., by estimating the cumulative effects and relative importance of
   multiple hypothesized pathways linking climatic changes and the dynamics of
   exploited species.

My second and third chapters advance our understanding about the relationships
between two alternative meso-scale ocean processes and productivity of Pacific
salmon. My fourth chapter extends this work by assessing the evidence for
multiple environmental forcing pathways to influence the dynamics of Pacific
salmon dynamics. Together, these three chapters provide evidence that multiple
environmental pathways---including multiple pathways arising from the same
climatic process---can simultaneously impact the dynamics of
higher-trophic-level species.

Only considering a single pathway/mechanisms is likely insufficient to
understand how environmental forcing impacts living marine resources. We also
need to understand the relative importance and cumulative effects of multiple
pathways.

For example, the results of chapter 1 indicate that biological oceanographic
processes (e.g. phytoplankton phenology) that are largely driven by vertical
ocean transport mechanisms are strongly associated with salmon productivity.
Similarly, results of chapter 2 indicated that horizontal ocean transport is
also strongly associated with salmon productivity in some regions. Finally,
chapter 3 indicated that multiple environmental pathways originating with the
PDO had strong effects on salmon dynamics. This suggests that future research
effects should focus on understanding the relative importance and cumulative
effects of multiple potential pathways linking large-scale climatic processes
and the dynamics of higher trophic level species.

In addition to the specific contributions of each chapter, this thesis provides
two important contributions to our understanding of how environmental forcing
impacts the dynamics of higher-trophic-level species. First, this thesis
provides evidence that multiple environmental pathways, potentially arising from
the same climatic process, can simultaneously impact the dynamics of
higher-trophic-level species. For example, the results of chapter 1 indicate
that biological oceanographic processes (e.g. phytoplankton phenology) that are
largely driven by vertical ocean transport mechanisms are strongly associated
with salmon productivity. Similarly, results of chapter 2 indicated that
horizontal ocean transport is also strongly associated with salmon productivity
in some regions. Finally, chapter 3 indicated that multiple environmental
pathways originating with the PDO had strong effects on salmon dynamics. This
suggests that future research effects should focus on understanding the relative
importance and cumulative effects of multiple potential pathways linking
large-scale climatic processes and the dynamics of higher trophic level species.

Second, this thesis provides evidence that the  effects of environmental forcing
on higher-trophic-level species is non-stationary across space. In other words,
the functional form or magnitude of the effect size of ecological relationships
may be dependent on the spatial context. For example, chapters 1 and 2 indicated
sharp differences in the effects of phytoplankton dynamics and ocean current
patterns between the stocks that enter the ocean in the predominantly
downwelling domain of the Northern Gulf of Alaska and stocks that enter the
ocean in the more southern upwelling domain. Similar spatial non-stationarity
has also been shown in the relationships between sea surface temperature and
salmon productivity, where cooler sea surface temperatures tend to be associated
with increased salmon productivity in southern areas and lower productivity in
northern areas.


# Main conclusions from chapters

1. "Our results suggest that changes in spring bloom timing resulting from
   natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change could potentially
   cause latitudinal shifts in salmon productivity."

2. "Our results indicated that horizontal transport pathways may strongly
   influence population dynamics of Pacific salmon in the southern part of their
   North American ranges, but not the northern part, suggesting that different
   environmental pathways may underlie changes in salmon productivity in
   northern and southern areas for the species under consideration."

3. "Our results provide evidence that shifts in climate patterns could strongly
   influence recruitment simultaneously through multiple ecological pathways and
   highlight the importance of quantifying cumulative effects of these pathways
   on higher-trophic-level species."

4. "Our findings further suggest that ecosystem-based management policies need
   to explicitly account for mismatches in the scale at which ecosystem services
   are generated by highly migratory species and the scale at which human
   activities and natural processes impact those services."


# Practical implications

- A practical implication of this spatial non-stationarity is that relationships
  inferred from data in one location may not be applicable to another location.


# Ideas

   For example, results of chapter 4 indicated the strongest effects of
   horizontal ocean transport were limited in extent to stocks that enter the
   ocean south of approximately 55N.

- See @Szuwalski2015 for a discussion on using environmental-recruitment
  correlates to inform management. These observed relationships may be best
  used in MSE rather than to provide tactical management advice.

# Outline

1. Summary of the four research chapters
2. Main contributions resulting from this thesis
3. Challenges
    - non-stationarity
    - uncertainties will always be present
        - need methods to deal with these uncertainties
    - Need to account for multiple mechanisms/pathways
        - No 'smoking gun'
        - Multiple ecological pathways
        - Need to take into account multiple ecological pathways rather than
          searching for a mythical 'smoking gun'
    - top-down + fishing effects
    - environmental information and management advice
    - non-linearity
    - complexity
4. Outlook
    * Climate change impacts on importance of different pathways
    1. Extreme events
    2. Shifting temperature isotherms

* Macro-scale perspective is useful
    - Salmon ecology
    - Management and conservation


# Questions

1. What is the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forcing pathways?
2. How will changing distributions of marine species impact predator
   distributions and abundances?
3. How will ocean acidification impact food resource availability?
4. How will extreme climate and ocean events, e.g., marine heat waves, impact
   year class strength?
5. How do the effects of exploitation interact with environmental variability?
6. Do environmental driver population response relationships vary over time?
7. Is there evidence for threshold and other non-linear effects of the
   environment on Pacific salmon demographic rates?


* Does the relative importance of competing hypothesis change over time, that
  is, temporal non-stationarity

- As the climate changes at an unprecedented rate, maintaining viable and
  productive marine and anadromous fish populations will require the ability to
  anticipate how ecological perturbations affect demographic rates of exploited
  species. The contributions to our understanding of how climatic and ocean
  processes relate to demographic rates of Pacific salmon presented in this
  thesis and elsewhere represent a first step in increasing this ability.
  However, many important questions remain. For example, what is the relative
  importance of top-down and bottom-up forcing pathways and how will changing
  distributions of marine species impact this relative importance? How will
  changing thermal isotherms and increased ocean acidification impact food
  resource availability for juvenile Pacific salmon? What evidence is there for
  temporal non-stationarity in relationships between environmental forcing and
  productivity of exploited species? Over the next few decades, answering these
  types of questions may be a critical part of effectively managing our living
  marine resources.


# Management

The utility of the results of this thesis are likely best used in the context of
short-term projections of year class strength. Strategic management advice

are likely most applicable to providing short-term strategic management advice.
For example, probabilistic networks, such as the ones constructed in chapter
four, could be used provide one or two year forecasts of total recruitment of
salmon populations.

Moving toward a more mechanistic understanding of the drivers in population
processes will be needed to inform tactical-management advice.

3. The contributions to our understanding of how climatic and ocean processes
   relate to demographic rates of Pacific salmon presented in this thesis and
   elsewhere represent a first step in increasing our ability to maintain viable
   and productive Pacific salmon populations. The challenge still remains,
   however, how information about environmental driver and population response
   relationships can be used to inform applied management.

   Results of my fifth chapter provide some indication of how this challenge may
   be addressed.

   As management of marine resources increasingly moves towards ecosystem-based
   approaches to management, strategic management advice based on empirical
   evidence


This will likely occur at a species and system specific basis.

The utility of increasing our understanding of how environmental forcing impacts
living marine resources is largely dependent how

- 4--10 paragraphs in length

- See @Szuwalski2015 for a discussion on using environmental-recruitment
  correlates to inform management. These observed relationships may be best
  used in MSE rather than to provide tactical management advice.

- Only considering ocean bottom-up pathways is inherently incomplete
    - Factors determining productivity
        - Ocean conditions
        - Habitat availability (freshwater)
        - Density dependence
        - Fishing?
    - Top-down effects
    - Fishing effects
        - Evolutionary changes

- Management of salmon fisheries -- management trade-offs
    1. Biological conservation
    2. Economic efficiency
    3. Social equity

- North--south differences in productivity

- tactile management advice vs. scenarios
  - research on environmental effects on fish populations rarely provide
    tactile management advice, but are useful for scenario analysis

- "This research reveals several remaining challenges..."
- "As we continue to apply..."
- "Ultimately, ..."
- "In this thesis, I have sought to..."

# External examiner

- General info
  - General guidelines for selecting an external examiner are provided here:
    - <https://goo.gl/AEbVKy>

  - Guidelines for the external examiner can be found here:
    - <https://goo.gl/l0h7qb>

  - I am not allowed to contact the external examiner at anytime during the
    process

  - The External Examiner must receive a copy of the completed thesis
    minimally one month prior to the scheduled date of the thesis defence.

  - The External Examiner should send a written pre-defence report on the
    thesis, to the Dean of Graduate Studies only, to arrive at least two
    weeks before the date of the Thesis Defence

  - SFU covers the cost of videoconferencing charges when utilizing SFU
    facilities in the Library Thesis Defense Room.

  - Travel expenses for External Examiners are the responsibility of the
    hosting department and should he discussed with the Graduate Program
    Chair before making arrangements.

  - Ideally, the external examiner should be a professor at the level of
    Associate Professor, otherwise, additional documentation is needed to
    show the adequacy of the examiner.

    - If the proposed external examiner is an assistant professor make sure
      that they have the experience of having supervised a doctoral student
      through to completion. Often this can be determined from a publicly
      available CV.

    - If the proposed external examiner is not in an academic position, as
      is sometimes the case for the more applied fields, then it is
      recommended that you get them pre-approved by DGS (defence@sfu.ca)
      before sending them an informal invitation. Include with such a
      request an articulation, not only of why the proposed external
      examiner is a suitable choice, but also why going outside of academia
      is the best choice. There are lots of good potential external
      examiners that work in the industry and business â€” but there are also
      lots of potential external examiners in these exact same fields who
      have academic positions.

  published paper as a footnote in the thesis


# Thesis vs dissertation
- SFU info: <http://goo.gl/OrP0sU>

- Dictionary definitions:
  - Dissertation: "a long essay on a particular subject, especially one
    written as a requirement for the Doctor of Philosophy degree"

  - Thesis: "a long essay or dissertation involving personal research,
    written by a candidate for a college degree"

- From thesis definitions, it seems my PhD is better classified as a
  thesis than a dissertation because it involves 'personal research'
